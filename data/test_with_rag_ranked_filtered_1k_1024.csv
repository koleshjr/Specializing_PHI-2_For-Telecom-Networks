The basic idea behind this solution is based on the cell search procedure where a UE has to acquire the synchronization signal block (SSB). SSBs are transmitted in a burst, where different SSB in the burst have a different identifier (SB#) and each SSB is transmitted in a beam in a different direction. The maximum number of SSBs in a SS burst beams depends on the frequency. There are up to 4 SSBs if the frequency is under 3 GHz, up to 8 SSBs if the frequency is between 3 and 6 GHz, and up to 64 SSBs for frequencies higher than 6 GHz. Depending on the relative position of the UE with regard to a base station, the UE will measure a different power level for different beams. The UE will use the beam with the highest received power.

[3GPP Release 18],Priority treatment for access and attachment to the network,Priority treatment for QoS rule enforcement,Priority treatment for incoming sessions from other networks,Priority treatment for supplementary services,Priority treatment for handover,,,Standards specifications,"

Providing priority treatment to MPS-subscribed UEs during attachment/registration for radio access and network connectivity before the MPS application service session invocation requests improves the probability of an MPS session request being successful. This involves providing priority treatment for the signalling during the UE attachment for radio access and network connectivity based on a subscription profile. Prior to accessing subscription related information in the network, subscription related information stored in the UE is used, e.g., membership in the special access class required to be reserved for MPS use as per 3GPP TS 22.011 [6], or the special Access Identity used for MPS as per 3GPP TS 22.261 [7]. Without such priority treatment, a Service User’s UE might fail to gain radio access network and CN connectivity which in turn means that there is no access to the MPS application services (Voice, Video, and Data). Priority treatment before MPS session request increases the probability of successful MPS session establishment and any associated process for the Service User authorization (e.g., credential collection).

The DL transmissions are scheduled using dynamic assignments. The UE can initiate subsequent UL transmission only after reception of confirmation (dynamic UL grant or DL assignment) for the initial PUSCH transmission from the network. For subsequent UL transmission, the UE cannot initiate re-transmission over a CG resource.

When using RACH resources, the network can schedule subsequent UL and DL transmissions using dynamic UL grants and DL assignments, respectively, after the completion of the RA procedure.

When SDT procedure is initiated, AS security is applied for all the radio bearers enabled for SDT as specified in clause 5.3.13.3 of TS 38.331 [12]."

Up to 16 repetitions is introduced for a Msg3 PUSCH transmission scheduled by RAR UL grant or DCI format 0_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI. This is beneficial to enhance the coverage on both NUL and SUL. After carrier selection and BWP selection during the RACH initialization procedure, a UE requests repetition of Msg3 PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant via separate PRACH resource when the RSRP of DL path-loss reference fulfils a configured threshold. If requested by the UE, gNB decides whether or not to schedule repetition of the Msg3 PUSCH transmission. If scheduled, the number of repetitions N is indicated by the 2 MSBs of the MCS field in the RAR UL grant or in the DCI format 0_0; and the MCS index used for the PUSCH transmission is indicated by the 2 LSBs of the MCS field in the RAR UL grant or by the 3 LSBs of the MCS field in the DCI format 0_0.

The network broadcasts ephemeris information and common Timing Advance (common TA) parameters in each NTN cell. A UE shall acquire its GNSS position as well as the satellite ephemeris and common TA before connecting to an NTN cell. To achieve uplink synchronisation, before performing random access, the UE shall autonomously pre-compensate the Timing Advance, as well as the frequency doppler shift by considering the common TA, the UE position and the satellite position through the satellite ephemeris. In connected mode, the UE shall continuously update the Timing Advance and frequency pre-compensation, but the UE is not expected to perform GNSS acquisition. The UE does not perform any transmissions due to outdated satellite ephemeris, common TA or GNSS position based on timers. In connected mode, upon outdated satellite ephemeris and common Timing Advance, the UE re-acquires the broadcasted parameters and upon outdated GNSS position the UE moves to idle mode. The UEs may be configured to report Timing Advance at initial access or in connected mode. In connected mode triggered reporting of the Timing Advance is supported."

[3GPP Release 17],To optimize inter-system load balancing,To enhance energy efficiency,To measure PRB usage for MIMO,To improve mobility optimization,,,,Standards overview,"For FR2-2, extended values were introduced for several DRX parameters due to the shorter symbol duration for SCS of 480 and 960 kHz.

Upper Layer Enhancements

The support of RSSI and Channel Occupancy (CO) measurements was also carried over to FR2-2. For FR2-2, the configuration can also include bandwidth serving cell and TCI information for the RSSI measurement.

The enhancements to Idle/Inactive mode mobility (due to the possible existence of multiple independent operators on the same carrier) and paging (multiple paging monitoring occasions per PO) for NR-U are also re-used in FR2-2.

We note that Channel Access Priority Class (CAPC) which is used for QoS in NR-U as well as LTE LAA are not applicable to FR2-2.

Since LBT is optional for FR2-2, a new parameter is broadcast in SIB1 to indicate the LBT mode. The same information for neighbor cells can be included in measurement object for RRM and SIB3/SIB4 for Idle/Inactive mobility (RAN2 is still discussing this)."

This solution addresses Key Issue #3 on 5GC information exposure to authorized 3rd party for Application Layer AI/ML operation.

The intent of this solution is to propose a mechanism to enable the network operator to have the control for which UE is allowed for participation in the Application layer AI/ML operation. The 5G system can expose the network authorization status of the UE to the AF for the UE participation in the corresponding Application AI/ML operation. Such awareness of the network authorization status for the UE can assist the AF's decision for the UE selection for the corresponding Application AI/ML operation.

The overall design of this solution is as follows:"

In this solution, the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) information is used as the Location Info-UE, which is obtained by the GNSS chip in the ME from the GNSS. For the privacy issue, the user can manually configure the privacy setting based on the eLCS procedure to indicate whether the UE is allowed to submit its GNSS information to the core network. It is assumed the GNSS information is accurate.

If the AMF determines that the Location Info-UE and the Location Info-gNB are consistent, the subsequent procedures are normally performed.

If the AMF determines that the Location Info-UE and the Location Info-gNB are inconsistent, the registration rejection message may be sent to the UE, where the reason value carried indicates the location positioning of the UE.

question 9010,What is the purpose of the adaptation/interworking functions? [3GPP Release 18],To provide standardisation of service capabilities,To provide interfaces for supplementary services,To define the characteristics of bearers,To adapt bearers for fixed network use,To enable subscribers to control services,,,Standards specifications,"

Since the purpose of the adaptation mechanism is to improve the quality of the session, any adaptation signalling is based upon some trigger; either a received indication or a measurement. In the case of a measurement trigger, it is important to gather reliable statistics. This requires a measurement period which is sufficiently long to give a reliable estimation of the channel quality but also sufficiently short to enable fast adaptation. For typical MTSI scenarios on 3GPP accesses, a measurement period in the order of 100 packets is recommended. Further, in order to have an adaptation control which is reliable and stable, a hangover period is needed after a new state has been entered (typically 100 to 200 packets). An even longer hangover period is suitable when transiting from an error resilient state or a reduced rate into the default, normal state. In the below examples, it is assumed that the metric used in the adaptation is the packet loss rate measured on the application layer. It is possible to use other metrics such as lower layer channel quality metrics."

question 9023,When can a UE determine PDCCH monitoring occasions for a search space set in the active DL BWP? [3GPP Release 17],If the active DL BWP matches the initial DL BWP in SCS configuration and cyclic prefix,If the CORESET bandwidth is within the active DL BWP,If the active DL BWP and initial DL BWP have the same subcarrier spacing,If the active DL BWP has same SCS configuration and cyclic prefix as the initial DL BWP,,,,Standards specifications,"with. The network configures at most 2 search space groups per BWP where the group ID is either 0 or 1 if searchSpaceGroupIdList-r16 is included. The network configures at most 3 search space groups per BWP where the group ID is either 0, 1 or 2 if searchSpaceGroupIdList-r17 is included. And if searchSpaceGroupIdList-r17 is included, searchSpaceGroupIdList-r16 is ignored. searchSpaceId Identity of the search space. SearchSpaceId = 0 identifies the searchSpaceZero configured via PBCH (MIB) or ServingCellConfigCommon and may hence not be used in the SearchSpace IE. The searchSpaceId is unique among the BWPs of a Serving Cell. In case of cross carrier scheduling, search spaces with the same searchSpaceId in scheduled cell and scheduling cell are linked to each other. The UE applies the search space for the scheduled cell only if the DL BWPs in which the linked search spaces are configured in scheduling cell and scheduled cell are both active. For an IAB-MT, the search space defines how/where to search for PDCCH candidates for an IAB-MT where each search space is associated with one ControlResearchSet and for a scheduled cell in the case of cross carrier scheduling, except for nrofCandidates, all the optional fields are absent. SearchSpaceLinkingId This parameter is used to link two search spaces of same type in the same BWP. If two search spaces have the same SearchSpaceLinkingId UE assumes these search spaces are linked to PDCCH repetition REF. When PDCCH repetition is monitored in two linked search space (SS) sets, the UE does not expect a third monitored SS set to be linked with any of the two linked SS sets. The two linked SS sets have the same SS set type (USS/CSS). The two linked SS sets have the same DCI formats to monitor. For intra-slot PDCCH repetition: The two SS sets should have the same periodicity and offset (monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset), and the same duration. For linking monitoring occasions across the two SS sets that exist in the same slot: The two SS sets have the same number of monitoring occasions within a slot and n-th monitoring occasion of one SS set is linked to n-th monitoring occasion of the other SS set. The following SS sets cannot be linked with another SS set for PDCCH repetition: SS set 0, searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation, pagingSearchSpace, ra-SearchSpace, searchSpaceMCCH, searchSpaceMTCH, peiSearchSpace, and sdt-SearchSpace. SS set configured by recoverySearchSpaceId cannot be linked to another SS set for PDCCH repetition. When a scheduled serving cell is configured to be cross-carrier scheduled by a scheduling serving cell, two PDCCH candidates (with the same AL and candidate index associated with the scheduled serving cell) are linked only if the corresponding two SS sets in the scheduling serving cell are linked and two SS sets in the scheduled serving cell with the same SS set IDs are also linked. This parameter is not applicable to search space configured with dci-FormatsSL for monitoring format 3-0 or format 3-1 or for monitoring formats 3-0 and format 3-1. searchSpaceType Indicates whether this is a common search space (present) or a UE specific search space as well as DCI formats to monitor for. ue-Specific Configures this search space as UE specific search space (USS).

Inter-donor topological redundancy also interconnects two IAB-topologies where the dual-connected IAB-node assumes the role of the boundary node. F1 and non-F1 traffic of the dual-connected IAB-node and its descendent nodes can be gradually migrated between the two paths via either the MN’s or the SN’s IAB-donor-DU. The XnAP IAB Transport Migration Management/Modification procedures are used for the coordination between MN and SN IAB-donors for this traffic migration.

MINT aims to enable a UE to obtain service from a PLMN offering Disaster Roaming service when a Disaster Condition applies to the UE's determined PLMN.

First, there are some assumptions as follows:

Disaster Condition only applies to NG-RAN nodes, which means the rest of the network functions except one or more NG-RAN nodes of the PLMN with Disaster Condition can be assumed to be operational.

The network nodes and NG-RAN are configured with Disaster Condition via OAM based on operator policy and the request by the government agencies.

Based on the requirements for Disaster Roaming service as specified in TS 22.011 [2] and clause 6.31 of TS 22.261 [3], the support of Disaster Roaming with Minimization of Service Interruption is specified in clause 5.40 of TS 23.501 [4] as the following overall descriptions;

question 9585,How is PDCCH skipping configured for UE power saving in connected mode? [3GPP Release 17],By providing skipping duration,By indicating skipping start slot,By indicating skipping end slot,All of the above,None of the above,,,Standards overview,"on all serving cells of the corresponding Cell Group when SR is sent and is pending;

on SpCell while contention resolution timer is running;

on SpCell during monitoring of the RAR/MsgB window.

UE can be configured with both Rel-17 SSSG configuration and PDCCH skipping durations. In this case, UE performs either SSSG switching or PDCCH skipping based on the PDCCH monitoring adaptation indication field in a detected DCI format 0_1/0_2/1_1/1_2.

Relaxation of UE measurements for RLM and/or BFD in connected mode

UE power saving can be enabled by UE relaxing measurements for RLM/BFD. When configured, UE determines whether its serving cell radio link quality is better than a threshold and, if criterion is configured, whether it is in low mobility state. The configuration for good serving cell quality criterion and, if included, low mobility criterion is provided through dedicated signalling."

question 9587,Which type of V2X application primarily uses broadcast-based communication? [3GPP Release 17],V2V,V2I,V2N,V2P,,,,Standards specifications,"This is an enhancement to the features specified for the application layer support for V2X applications in TS 23.286 [1]. The enhancement features support advanced V2X services (e.g. Tele-Operated Driving, HD Maps) considering the existing stage 1 and stage 2 work within 3GPP related to V2X enhancements in TS 22.185 [2], TS 22.186 [3], TS 23.285 [4] and TS 23.287 [5], as well as V2X application requirements defined outside 3GPP (e.g. 5GAA, ETSI ITS, SAE).

The following capabilities are added in the V2X Application Enabler (VAE) layer:

a)	Assistance for V2V communication mode switching enables provisioning the V2X UE to apply V2V communication modes switching policies from the V2X application specific layer."
question 9595,What is the purpose of the Quick release of RRC connection feature in NB-IoT? [3GPP Release 15],To provide a more efficient user data security mechanism,To enable the UE to request NPUSCH resources for BSR transmission,To reduce system acquisition time for the UE,To support small cell deployments with lower maximum transmit power,To reduce UE power consumption during idle mode,,,Standards overview,"In Rel-13/14 NB-IoT, scheduling request (SR) exists only as a higher-layer procedure, which triggers a random access procedure to request sufficient UL resource to send a buffer status report (BSR). Rel-15 has added new, more resource and power efficient, ways to achieve this goal which can be configured by the eNB.

For a connected mode UE, eNB is able to configure by RRC periodic NPUSCH resources for the UE to send BSR, so the eNB is informed when pending traffic has arrived in the UE's buffer. The resources are activated and de-activated ('released') by dynamic signalling on NPDCCH.

A connected mode UE is able to send, in the physical layer, a request to the eNB to be granted NPUSCH resources to send a BSR. This can be done either by a dedicated signal using a pre-configured NPRACH transmission, or via 'piggybacking' the request onto HARQ ACK or NACK transmission from the UE if one is available, by applying a cover code to the ACK or NACK symbols.

Early data transmission (FDD)"
question 9597,Which sublayer is responsible for error correction through HARQ? [3GPP Release 18],RLC sublayer,MAC sublayer,PDCP sublayer,SDAP sublayer,,,,Standards specifications,"When the system simulator is configured for error insertion in the downlink at the MAC/PHY layer and DRX operation, and the system simulator implements the HARQ re-transmissions and the mapping of the packets to the DRX cycle time at the downlink. In this case, the model simulates the delay and loss profiles from the sending UE up to the receiving eNB. This testing condition is currently not used in 3GPP TS 26.132.

It should be noted that the model does not fully utilize the PDB for QCI1 as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 and does not include temporary variations of the packet arrival time variation and the loss rate that may be experienced during e.g. hand-over or congestion. Hence, the packet delay and loss profiles generated by the model do not fully exercise the conditions that the jitter buffer management of the UE may be exposed to in LTE systems and the profiles generated by the model are only intended for the testing of the UE delay in stationary operating conditions."
question 9602,Which scenarios are supported by the 5G-RG? [3GPP Release 16],Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) and Hybrid scenario,Wireline access and Trusted Non-3GPP access,Non-roaming architecture for FN-RG and 5G Core Network,"Access Traffic Steering, Switch, and Splitting in the 5G system architecture",Support of BBF interaction with the Access Configuration System (ACS),,,Standards overview,"The 5G-RG can also be connected via 3GPP Access basically by means of supporting the specification defined for UE. This scenario is called Fixed Wireless Access (FWA). Furthermore the 5G-RG may simultaneously connect to 3GPP Access and to wireline access by using the Single Access PDU session or supporting ATSSS feature. This scenario is called Hybrid scenario, using a terminology common on wireline access network. The ATSSS is supported as specified in TS 23.501, 23.502 and TS 23.503 where UE is replaced by 5G-RG and the Non-3GPP access (es) is specifically referred to wireline access. In this latter case, TS 23.316 has also specified the support of interworking with EPC via 3GPP Access via a MA PDU session with a PDN Connection as user-plane resource associated with a MA PDU Session."
question 9607,Which component invokes the Nnef_PFDManagement_Create/Update/Delete service? [3GPP Release 18],SMF,NEF,UDR,AF,,,,Standards specifications,"To remove the PFDs for an existing individual application, the AF invokes the Nnef_PFDmanagement_Delete service operation by sending the HTTP DELETE request to the resource ""Individual Application PFD Management"".

NOTE 1:	For details of Nnef_PFDmanagement_Create/Update/Delete service operations refer to 3GPP TS 29.522 [24].

2.	The NEF checks whether the application is authorized to perform this request based on the operator policies.

3.	The NEF invokes Nudr_DataRepository operation service to the UDR as follows:

if PFDs creation for a new application identifier was requested in step 1, the NEF shall invoke the Nudr_DataRepository_Create service operation by sending an HTTP PUT request message to the resource ""Individual PFD Data"" for the requested application identifier."
question 9610,What is the purpose of the Edge Configuration Server (ECS) specified in TS 23.558? [3GPP Release 17],To enable discovery of Edge Application Servers,To provide configurations to the Edge Enabler Client (EEC),To support service provisioning for UE,To expose EES capability as APIs to EAS,To enable service continuity during UE mobility,,,Standards overview,"Support of 3GPP application layer architecture for enabling Edge Computing: An Edge Configuration Server (ECS) is specified in TS 23.558[3] to support 3GPP application layer architecture for enabling Edge Computing. The ECS address provisioning to UE via 5GC is defined to support such a mechanism.

AF guidance to PCF determination of URSP rules: An AF related with Edge computing may need to guide PCF determination of proper URSP rules, so that the URSP configured on the UE can consider the requirements of application. The application guidance for URSP rules determination mechanisms defined in clause 4.15.6.10 of TS 23.502[4].

[3GPP Release 16],UE mobility status and serving cell beam status,Link quality and UE mobility status,UE is not at cell edge and UE mobility status,UE mobility status and exact relaxation criteria,UE mobility status and UE type,,,Standards specifications,"RRM measurement relaxation: The legacy LTE-MTC UE behavior requires the UE to measure on the serving cell and evaluate the cell selection criterion at least every DRX cycle. The wake-up signal (WUS) introduced in Rel-15 would allow the UE to sleep for multiple paging cycles and wake up to receive paging after a configurable time duration, but the UE power saving gain from WUS cannot be fully utilized since the UE is still required to wake up for measurements. Therefore, an RRM measurement relaxation is introduced in Rel-16, which allows the UE meet the requirements using a longer measurement cycle to save power, where the cycle is configurable under certain conditions.

Performance improvement for NR coexistence

Spectrum sharing with legacy (Rel-13/14/15) LTE-MTC is already supported in Rel-15 NR, and the RF coexistence aspects described in TR 37.823. The following features are introduced in Rel-16 LTE-MTC in order to further improve the performance of the coexistence with NR."

Up to 16 repetitions is introduced for a Msg3 PUSCH transmission scheduled by RAR UL grant or DCI format 0_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI. This is beneficial to enhance the coverage on both NUL and SUL. After carrier selection and BWP selection during the RACH initialization procedure, a UE requests repetition of Msg3 PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant via separate PRACH resource when the RSRP of DL path-loss reference fulfils a configured threshold. If requested by the UE, gNB decides whether or not to schedule repetition of the Msg3 PUSCH transmission. If scheduled, the number of repetitions N is indicated by the 2 MSBs of the MCS field in the RAR UL grant or in the DCI format 0_0; and the MCS index used for the PUSCH transmission is indicated by the 2 LSBs of the MCS field in the RAR UL grant or by the 3 LSBs of the MCS field in the DCI format 0_0. The Msg3 PUSCH transmission is performed over N slots, which is counted based on available slots. Only inter-slot frequency hopping is supported if N>1 is indicated for the PUSCH transmission. "

question 10009,"During RAN congestion, what can the RAN drop to prioritize transmission of more important data?",P frame,UL data,B frame,I frame,,,,,"6.13	Solution #13: DL data handling

6.13.1	Key Issue mapping

The solution applies to Key Issue #5 Differentiated PDU Set Handling.

6.13.2	Description

When the RAN congestion happens, in order to prioritize the transmission of the more important data (e.g. I frame), the RAN can drop the less important DL data (e.g. B frame) to the UE. During the congestion period, the continuous less importance data from the UPF to the RAN may cause the RAN more congested and waste the transport layer resource between the RAN and the UPF. The UPF can also drop some less important data to the RAN when RAN is congested. Besides, the existing FAR has supported to block or buffer chose data at the UPF.

Hence, the solution proposes to make UPF not to transmit the less important DL data to the RAN when the RAN congestion happens."

Data Collection Coordination is supported by a DCCF or an NWDAF. The Data Consumer may use an NRF to perform NF discovery and selection to find a DCCF that can coordinate data collection (DCCF discovery principles are defined in clause 6.3.19 of TS 23.501 [2]). Data Consumers send requests for data to the DCCF rather than directly to the NF Data Source. Whether the data consumers directly contact the NF Data Source or goes via the DCCF is based on configuration of the data consumers. For the Data Consumer and each notification endpoint in a data request, the Data Consumer may specify Formatting and Processing Instructions that determine how the data is to be provided. Upon receiving a request from a Data Consumer, the selected DCCF determines the NF instance that can be a Data Source if the Data Source is not indicated in the Data Consumer's request. The DCCF may also select an ADRF if the data is to be stored in an ADRF and an ADRF endpoint is not indicated in the Data Consumer's request. To retrieve data for a specific UE, the NRF, UDM or BSF can provide the DCCF with the identity of the Data Source using the services indicated in table 5A.2-1."

question 10054,How does the energy consumption of AR/MR applications compare to non-AR/MR applications?,AR/MR applications consume less energy,AR/MR applications consume the same amount of energy,AR/MR applications consume slightly more energy,AR/MR applications consume significantly more energy,None of the above,,,,"

The run time of a typical battery is proportional to its physical size, capacity, and weight, while they are proportional to user discomfort and neck torque. A study on the characteristics of AR applications [27] measured battery consumption of commercially available applications on AR, streaming, and social networking which shows that AR applications consume around at least 46% more energy than non-AR applications. The capacity of the battery needs to be designed to support a fair amount of running time for the everyday use of AR/MR applications. The amount of running time could be from tens of minutes for shopping of products via AR remote advertising in Annex A.2, 1-2 hours for streaming of volumetric video in Annex A.3, or even several hours for AR gaming in Annex A.6. However, as capacity is typically proportional to weight, and as the AR glasses is expected to be worn and equipped under the consideration of human ergonomics such as neck strain, there are clear limitations on extending the capacity of the battery. Such limitations may be relaxed by dynamically offloading some energy-intensive workloads to 5G cloud/edge. In this case, local processing power consumption is exchanged with power consumption for 3GPP/non-3GPP connectivity and an always on connectivity as well. For connectivity Discontinuous Reception (DRX) and Reduced Capability (RedCap) may be one of examples looking for lower power consumption for the radio for AR/MR application."

question 10108,"If the XRM AF does not know that the GFBR is changed, what can happen?",The QNC messages will be delayed,The PCF cannot generate PCC rules,The XRM service will be terminated,The NG-RAN will soon be in a congestion state,,,,,"The XRM service is assumed to use high data rate (e.g. 360o 3D VR video) and low latency (e.g. interactive cloud gaming). If the GFBR is changed to very low value, e.g. the UE enters an elevator or basement with very poor radio signalling or the UE enters in the quick moving vehicle. If the XRM AF does not know the GFBR is changed, the XRM AF continues the DL high data rate to the NG-RAN, the NG-RAN will soon be in congestion state. In such case, the NG-RAN needs to quickly provide the GFBR changes for the XRM services to the XRM AF. But if the default AW is used, the 2000ms measurement time is some large and introduces large latency to generate the QNC for the NG-RAN. In such case, to reduce the latency from the GFBR change to generating a QNC in order to reduce the chance of NG-RAN congestion, a lower value AW should be used."

Only in this configuration, the full set of 5G Phase 1 services are supported.

The NSA architecture is illustrated in the following figure.

Figure 5.3.2-1: The NSA Architecture

The NSA architecture can be seen as a temporary step towards ""full 5G"" deployment, where the 5G Access Network is connected to the 4G Core Network. In the NSA architecture, the (5G) NR base station (logical node ""en-gNB"") connects to the (4G) LTE base station (logical node ""eNB"") via the X2 interface. The X2 interface was introduced prior to Release 15 to connect two eNBs. In Release 15, it also supports connecting an eNB and en-gNB as to provide NSA. 

The NSA offers dual connectivity, via both the 4G AN (E-UTRA) and the 5G AN (NR). It is thus also called ""EN-DC"", for ""E-UTRAN and NR Dual Connectivity"".

In EN-DC, the 4G's eNB is the Master Node (MN) while the 5G's en-gNB is the Secondary Node (SN)."

question 10127,"In the context of multiple CDRX configurations, what triggers the UE to switch between configurations?",UDM update,Reception of I-frame,Power status change,Traffic pattern change,,,,,"

Sol#34: RAN provides UE with multiple CDRX configurations or adaptable CDRX configuration. Based on the UE's operating mode, e.g. high-power or low-power, UE may choose to move from one CDRX configuration to another, or may choose to modify the CDRX configuration parameter, then UE indicates to the RAN node which CDRX configuration is used. In this solution, with the status of power consumption at UE, CDRX parameters may change and thus may have impact at transmission latency, the QoS parameters (e.g. GFBR/MFBR/PDB/PER) are not changed. Trade-off of throughput/reliability and power consumption is not supported, for trade-off of latency and power consumption, as the PDB is not changed, the impact from CDRX could be minor. This solution requires multiple signalling handshakes between the UE and the network in order to (constantly) change the applied CDRX configuration, therefore causing additional UE power consumption and costing radio capacity. No evidence has been shown the solution provides gains over existing CDRX mechanism. CDRX is under full responsibility of RAN WG2."

After receiving this subscription request, the SMF does a third-party subscription onto UPF on behalf of this consumer. The consumer should also provide the subscribed UPF event to SMF.

Event Filters are used to specify the conditions to match for notifying the events (i.e. ""List of Parameter values to match""). If there are no conditions to match for a specific Event ID, then the Event Filter is not provided. The following table provides as an example how the conditions to match for event reporting can be specified for various Event IDs for SMF exposure.

When reporting via the LMF, the UE sends a supplementary services event report over the user plane connection to the LMF with one or more LPP messages included in the event report. The LMF then verifies or determines a location estimate and sends the event report with the location estimate to the LCS Client or AF over a second user plane connection. This can still reduce latency and increase signalling efficiency.

5.	The control plane associations between the UE and LMF, LMF and V-GMLC/H-GMLC and H-GMLC and LCS Client or NEF and AF are retained to allow the status of event reporting to be conveyed to the H-GMLC (and NEF if used) and to support cancellation of event reporting using the existing control plane procedures in clauses 6.3.2 and 6.3.3. in TS 23.273 [5].

X86 and similar server architectures have a number of physical security weaknesses from a critical national infrastructure perspective. Plug and play interfaces (e.g. USB and removal RAID discs) unless disabled or tightly controlled represent a risk to 3GPP NF security. However, more difficult to control attack vectors such as PCI Express bus Direct Memory Access (DMA) or use of OS swap/page files represent risks if physical access to the server(s) hosting a 3GPP NF is possible. Similarly, whilst most server firmware would detect hardware changes (e.g. adding an extra copy physical network port which is visible to the host firmware), detection is more difficult where the replacement hardware uses the same IDs and declared interfaces."

4.4.1	Access to VNFs via virtualisation layer

Most virtualisation platforms make it possible for a user with root access to the virtualisation layer, to view and edit the memory of hosted VMs. This administrator may be able to change or stop processes running in the VM, give other applications access to the VM or steal security critical data. These challenges are discussed in ETSI GS NFV-SEC 009 [3].

An attacker may have access to the virtualisation layer via a variety of means. The access could be legitimate, such as a rogue employee at the hosting company, or illegitimate i.e. hyper jacking. From the point of view of the VNF, these attack vectors are the same, as they both result in a rogue actor gaining access. In general, such access would be invisible to the VNF.

The main principles of this solution are as follows:

1.	The solution applies to event reporting for a periodic or triggered deferred 5GC-MT-LR.

2.	The target UE uses a user plane connection to report events to the LCS Client or AF, either directly or via the LMF or H-GMLC.

3.	When reporting directly to the LCS Client or AF or reporting via an H-GMLC, the UE sends a supplementary services event report (e.g. as defined in TS 24.080 [21]) over the user plane connection with a location estimate included. This could significantly reduce end-to-end latency because the event report no longer needs to be transferred via control plane through the NG-RAN, AMF, LMF, GMLC and possibly NEF.

question 10230,What are the functions of multiple media decoders management and coordination in AR/MR?,To optimize the use of hardware decoding platform,To avoid resource competition and synchronization issues,To manage multiple decoder instances for different media components,All of the above,None of the above,,,,"

In order to integrate real-time media into AR scenes, a Media Access Function (MAF) provides the ability to access media and adds it to the AR scene. The MAF instantiates and manages Media Pipelines. A media pipeline typically handles content of an attribute/component of an object/mesh that is part of the scene graph. The media pipeline produces content in the format indicated by the scene description file. For real-time media, the formatted frame is then pushed into the circular buffer. Media Pipelines are typically highly optimized and customized for the type and format of media that is being fetched. Typically, for one scene, multiple media decoders of the same media type are needed to run in parallel. If the media decoders share the same hardware decoding platform on the UE, the MAF may also coordinate the different instances of media decoders to optimise the use of the hardware platform thus avoiding negative effects of resource competition or possible synchronization issues. MPEG-I Video Decoding Interface (ISO/IEC 23090-13 [6]) is an example specification that may fulfil this task of coordination. More information is available in clause 4.6.6. General considerations and challenges related to media decoder management is described in clause 4.4.6. Media Pipelines also maintain sync information (time and space) and passes that information as buffer metadata to the scene manager."

question 10317,What can a location client do based on the analytics of location accuracy?,Upgrade/downgrade the requested LCS QoS,Adapt the application service accordingly,Both option 1 and option 2,None of the above,Request data from the NWDAF,,,,"When the LMF determines the location the LMF also determines the accuracy of the location and also whether the location requirements are met which are sent to the GMLC. The GMLC responds to the client the accuracy of the location measurement can be met.

Analytics from the NWDAF can be enhanced to allow a location client to be aware if a location accuracy can be met. Example consumers of such analytics is as follows:

LMF uses the analytics to identify the best positioning method to use to determine a location in a specific area, taking into account UE capabilities, QoS requirements and operator policies.

The location client can determine to upgrade/downgrade the requested LCS QoS taking into account the analytics of location accuracy.

The location client can adapt the application service accordingly. For example, a navigation service can take into account areas where location accuracy cannot be met when providing route guidance.

Solution #1 suggests that the coverage information may be derived by the AMF based on the satellite assistance information from RAN, e.g. satellite id, satellite ephemeris. Solution #4 and Solution #5 both suggest to enable the provision of satellite coverage information to the AMF by RAN via existing UE Location Reporting procedures. However, all these solutions have RAN dependency which should be discussed and checked by RAN WGs. Also RAN based solutions are only applicable to the UEs with limited mobility, e.g. stationary.

Monitoring based on inference accuracy, including metrics related to intermediate KPIs

Monitoring based on system performance, including metrics related to system peformance KPIs

Other monitoring solutions, at least the following 2 options.

Monitoring based on data distribution

Output-based: e.g., drift detection of output data

Monitoring based on applicable condition"
question 10322,What can be used to buffer DL packets in the network or notify the AF about UE reachability?,HLCOM,PSM mode,MICO mode,eDRX parameters,,,,,"An AF may request repeated ""Downlink Data Delivery Status"" notifications when it wants indications that DL data has been buffered or when buffered DL data has been delivered to the UE.

If MICO mode or extended idle mode DRX is enabled, Idle Status Indication allows the AF to determine when the UE transitions into idle mode. When requesting to be informed of either ""UE Reachability"" or ""Availability after DDN failure"" notification, the AF may also request Idle Status Indication. If the UDM and the AMF support Idle Status Indication, then when the UE for which MICO mode or extended idle mode DRX is enabled transitions into idle mode, the AMF includes in the notification towards the NEF the time at which the UE transitioned into idle mode, the active 



time and the periodic registration update timer granted to the UE by the AMF, the eDRX cycle length and the Suggested number of downlink packets if a value was provided to the SMF."
question 10323,What can dropping P and B frames in XRM services cause?,Improvement in network resource utilization,Priority transmission of I frames,Enhancement of high definition,Jitter in video quality,,,,,"Besides, in some XRM service, P frame and B frame are also important as I frame to construct the fluent video, dropping of those P frame and B frame causes jitter to the QoE which is not better than giving up the whole service. In some other XRM service, P frame and B frame are used to enhance the high definition, e.g. from 720p to 1080p. dropping of those P frame and B frame makes sense to keep the service when the network resource cannot transmit all of the service data.

Hence, the data allowed to be intended dropped shall be authorized by the application server, i.e. from the AF.

The solution is based on the existing QoS policy control and FAR with the following enhancement:

The AF provides description of data allowed to be dropped and description of data requiring prioritized transmission. The description of data allowed to be dropped is used to identify the data allowed to be dropped and it should be valid under some conditions, e.g. when the network cannot transmit all of the data of service flow."
question 10324,What can the AMF do if it rejects the UE Registration Request?,Forward the analytics to NG-RAN,Discover NWDAF instance,Initiate UE release procedure,Accept or reject UE location,Provide a cause value to the NG-RAN,,,,"If the AMF is not configured to support Emergency Registration, the AMF shall reject any Registration Request that indicates Registration type ""Emergency Registration"".

If the AMF is configured to support Emergency Registration for unauthenticated UEs and the UE indicated Registration Type ""Emergency Registration"", the AMF skips the authentication and security setup or the AMF accepts that the authentication may fail and continues the Emergency Registration procedure.

If the authentication is performed successfully, the NAS messages will be protected by the NAS security functions (integrity and ciphering). The AMF shall derive the N3IWF key, per TS 33.501 [15] and shall provide it to the N3IWF after the authentication completion using an NGAP Initial Context Setup Request message as in the regular registration procedure."

question 10326,What can the UE do when it again has coverage in Power Saving Mode (PSM)?,Trigger a TAU to request new Active Time and Periodic TAU Timer values,Transition to MICO mode,Access the PLMN and initiate signaling,Request a new eDRX cycle length,,,,,"If the UE initiates UL without knowing that it will be out of coverage soon due to lack of information it has, the UE may fail to communicate when coverage is lost. Therefore, if the network can indicate a timer to the UE, or the UE can determine such a timer, before the UE will be out of coverage, UE can decide not to send any UL data/signalling during the time.

Existing power saving modes (e.g. MICO, PSM, eDRX) do not prevent the UE's MO data and signalling and it is not assumed that the UE will be out of coverage for a long time. A different mode is needed to prevent the UE from sending MO data/signalling while out of coverage for power saving enhancement.

If no data is received steps10-12 are skipped and the eNodeB may trigger step 14 after step 13 detects no activity. While the RRC connection is active, the UE may still send Uplink data and may receive Downlink data in NAS PDUs that are carried in a S1AP Uplink or (respectively) Downlink messages (not shown in the figure). At any time the UE has no user plane bearers established it may provide NAS Release Assistance Information with the Uplink data. In this case, to assist Location Services, the eNodeB may indicate, if needed, the UE's Coverage Level to the MME.

The AMF/MME will then provide the eDRX parameters to the UE based on UE requested values, subscription data, etc.

In this solution, the UE can request eDRX parameters based on its awareness of the coverage information. The eDRX cycle length is defined in TS 24.008 [8] and can only express certain fixed values. The available eDRX cycles may therefore not match the timing of the coverage and out-of-coverage for a UE. The UE may in this case request a eDRX cycle length that is less than the coverage window to ensure that the UE is reachable within the window. TAI or RAT specific AMF/MME configuration can be used to allow the AMF/MME to use the UE requested value when assigning the eDRX parameter in the reply to the UE."

The RE power control dynamic range was derived by considering the relation between RE power boosting/de-boosting and other RF requirements like UEM, ACLR and EVM. For ATG BS, since the same waveform as NR is used, the existing requirement defined in TS 38.104 [5] can be applicable. 

Total power dynamic range

The BS total power dynamic range is the difference between the maximum and the minimum transmit power of an OFDM symbol for a specified reference condition. It can be calculated by 10log10 (NRB). The Total power dynamic range for ATG BS can reuse the requirement from TN BS in 3GPP TS 38.104 [5] for the same channel bandwidth.

question 10430,What does the AF provide to the NEF/PCF as a new request QoS parameter?,GFBR measurement,Requested AW,AF session information,SMF information,,,,,"6.8.1	Introduction

This solution is proposed to solve Key Issue #4: Enable an AF to explicitly provide the required PER to the NEF/PCF for QoS and Alt-QoS.

In Release 17, the ""Setting up an AF session with required QoS"" procedure (clause 4.15.6.6 of TS 23.502 [3]) and the ""AF Session with required QoS update"" procedure (clause 4.15.6.6a of TS 23.502 [3]) were revised so the AF can provide individual parameters for QoS and Alt-QoS. Inclusion of PER as an individual parameter requested by the AF was postponed to Release18. PER is a QoS Characteristic as defined in clause 5.7.3.1 of TS 23.501 [2], similar to PDB which was included as an individual parameter. PER is also currently part of the Alternative QoS Profile, along with PDB and GFBR. PDB and GFBR as individual parameters for Alt-QoS were addressed in Release 17.

This solution adds Requested PER to the AF request for QoS and Alternative QoS.

The AF request shall contain an ASP identifier, either a QoS Reference or individual QoS parameters, the Number of UEs, the list of Desired time windows and, if the AF can adjust to different QoS parameter combinations, the AF may, in addition, provide Alternative Service Requirements in a prioritized order as defined in clause 6.1.3.22, Network Area Information, and Request for notification. As Network Area Information, the AF may provide either a geographical area (e.g. a civic address or shapes), or an area of interest that includes a list of TAs and/or a list of NG-RAN nodes or a list of cell identifiers. When the AF provides a geographical area, the NEF maps it, based on local configuration, into an area of interest (i.e. a list of TAs or NG-RAN nodes list or cells identifiers list) and provides it to the PCF. The Request for notification can be included in the AF request to indicate that the ASP accepts that the PDTQ policy can be re-negotiated using the PDTQ warning notification procedures described in clause 4.16.15.2 of TS 23.502 [3]."

Security is provided for the CU-DU interface. This split was also possible in LTE, but in 5G it is part of the architecture that can support a number of deployment options (e.g. co-located CU-DU deployment is also possible). The DUs, which are deployed at the very edge of the network, don't have access to any user data when confidentiality protection is enabled. Even with the CU-DU split, the air interface security point in 5G remains the same as in LTE, namely in the radio access network.

question 10444,What does the Control Format Indicator (CFI) indicate in LTE?,The modulation and coding scheme,The number of OFDM symbols used for PDCCH,The time reference,The frequency allocation,The number of PDSCH transmissions,,,,"Control Format Indicator (CFI) indicates how many OFDM symbols are used for the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH). In most cases, CFI is obtained by decoding the Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH). To ensure that PCFICH decoding does not degrade the overall downlink and uplink reliability, RRC configuration of CFI for any serving cell has been introduced in this work item. It is a separate CFI configuration for different Transmission Time Interval (TTI) lengths. If CFI is semi-statically configured for TTIs of different lengths, the UE does not expect the configured CFI values to be different. The semi-static CFI value can be configured separately for Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) and non-MBSFN subframes for each cell. When a UE is configured with a semi-static CFI for a given TTI length, the UE is not expected to decode PCFICH for that TTI length.

Virtualisation Layer, for example a hypervisor or container engine, which separates the VNF software from underlying hardware.

NOTE:	The choice to use a hypervisor or container engine as the virtualisation layer has security implications. In particular, containers do not present a security boundary, without use of additional security mechanisms.

Virtualised Resources.

VNFs run on top of the NFVI and are software implementations of network functions. A VNF may run in one Virtual Machine (VM) or over several VMs."

For UPF event exposure the UPF discovery is the necessary step to be considered. The UPF discovery can categorized as following option:

Option 1: NRF based discovery (sol#1). The UPF registered its NF profile to the NRF. The NF consumer query the NRF, per the related query information, the NRF return the related UPF meet the query request.

Option 2: SMF based discovery. There are further two option:

Option 2.1: Only SMF is discovered (Sol#8/9/10). NF consumer get the serving SMF of the UE from the UDM per SUPI, which may require getting SUPI from IP address first (via BSF) or using IP address (via BSF) (Sol#1, 6.1.2.5.1-1).

PDU-Set Delay Budget (PSDB)

The PDU-Set Delay Budget (PSDB) defines an upper bound for the time that a PDU-Set may be delayed between the UE and the N6 termination point at the UPF. PSDB applies to the DL PDU-Set received by the UPF over the N6 interface, and to the UL PDU-Set sent by the UE. For a certain 5QI the value of the PSDB is the same in UL and DL. In the case of 3GPP access, the PSDB is used to support the configuration of scheduling and link layer functions (e.g. the setting of scheduling priority weights and HARQ target operating points). For GBR QoS Flows using the Delay-critical resource type, a PDU-Set delayed more than PSDB is counted as lost if the QoS Flow is not exceeding the GFBR. For GBR QoS Flows with GBR resource type not exceeding GFBR, of the PDU-Sets shall commonly not experience a delay exceeding the 5QI's PSDB to a very high percentage."

6.12.3.2	PDU Set identification and marking on UPF

UPF can identify the PDUs of one PDU Set via different ways, e.g. the RTP headers/payloads in case RTP is used, the traffic periodicity. The UPF then add marks in the GTP-U headers of DL packets to assist RAN for the PDU Set identification, e.g. the start/end indication of the PDU Set and PDU Set ID. The identification of PDU Set depends on what the PDU Set represents, e.g. a video frame or a video slice.

question 10524,What does the SPRF use to exchange measurement results between UEs?,PC5 reference point,5G ProSe PC5,LTE PC5,All of the above,,,,,"If it is determined that more than two UEs need to participate in the operation, the GMSF service is invoked to form the group or determine the group members' presence and status for the operation.

SPRF signaling is used for the control signaling between the UEs to determine the corresponding Sidelink Positioning and Ranging operation, e.g. the channel to use for the Sidelink Positioning or Ranging reference signal, the sequence and time slot for each of the UE to perform the signal transmission and measurements.

The UEs, e.g. UE A and UE B, or in other cases a group of UEs, carry out the Sidelink Positioning or Ranging reference signal transmission and measurements.

Based on the Sidelink Positioning or Ranging services negotiated by the SPRF signaling in the earlier phase, the UEs uses the SPRF signaling to exchange the measurement results. This enables the UEs to perform the calculation of the range/direction, or relative locations."

8.6	Split Rendering Media Service Enabler with AR profile

In the context of this report, it was clearly identified that AR glasses depend on cloud or edge-based pre-rendering. However, not only AR glasses benefit from such a functionality, also for VR, XR and gaming, as identified in TR 26.928 and TR 26.926, would benefit from split rendering approaches. Hence, a basic Media Service Enabler for split rendering is paramount, in particular in combination with 5G new radio and 5G System capabilities.

The FLF within the LMS performs a location request to one or more of the following (based on the Location profile):

to GMLC directly or via NEF (see TS 23.273), acting as AF. The LCS service request is sent to GMLC or AMF, via NEF using the service-based interface or CAPIF API; or directly to GMLC if allowed to (e.g. fused location function is within the MNO trust domain).

to 3rd party location servers as described in KI#1.

7.	The FLF within the LMS calculates the fused location estimated based on combining location reports from previous steps, and may also perform additional processing e.g. for location augmentation, and verification based on the Location profile. Then, it checks whether the estimate fulfills the Location profile requirement (based on QoS parameters such as accuracy, response time). 

8-9.	If the requirement is not fulfilled, the FLF within the  LMS iteratively requests further location information and re-checks whether the requirement is met or not."

The bridge ID of the 5GS TSN bridge is bound to the UPF ID of the UPF as identified in TS 23.502 [3]. The TSN AF stores the binding relationship between a port on UE/DS-TT side and a PDU Session during reporting of 5GS TSN bridge information. The TSN AF also stores the information about ports on the UPF/NW-TT side. The UPF/NW-TT forwards traffic to the appropriate egress port based on the traffic forwarding information. From the TSN AF point of view, a 5GS TSN bridge has a single NW-TT entity within UPF and the NW-TT may have multiple ports that are used for traffic forwarding.

NOTE 1:	How to realize single NW-TT entity within UPF is up to implementation.

NOTE 2:	Ethernet PDU Session type in this release of the specification may be subject to the constraint that it supports a single N6 interface in a UPF associated with the N6 Network Instance."
question 10621,What happens after the user-plane resources for the MA PDU Session over the new Non-3GPP access network are established?,The UE decides to switch data traffic based on URSP policies from PCF,The UE triggers AMF to deregister from the old Non-3GPP access network,The SMF triggers the AMF to maintain two registrations via two non-3GPP accesses,The UE initiates a path switch by sending an MA PDU Session Establishment Request,The AMF initiates the user-plane resources establishment over the new Non-3GPP access network,,,,"NOTE 6:	If the AMF selects an SMF not supporting non-3GPP access path switching, the non-3GPP access path switching can still be performed with the AMF triggering release of the old user plane resources before new user plane resources are established.

After the MA PDU Session establishment:

At any given time, the MA PDU session may have user-plane resources on both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, or on one access only, or may have no user-plane resources on any access.

The AMF, SMF, PCF and UPF maintain their MA PDU Session contexts, even when the UE deregisters from one access (but remains registered on the other access).

When the UE deregisters from one access (but remains registered on the other access), the AMF informs the SMF to release the resource of this access type in the UPF for the MA PDU Session. Subsequently, the SMF notifies the UPF that the access type has become unavailable and the N3/N9 tunnel for the access type are released."
question 10622,What happens if a Data Source changes while persisting event exposure subscriptions?,The subscriptions are transferred to a new Data Source,The subscriptions are cancelled,The subscriptions are modified,The subscriptions are temporarily suspended,,,,,"registration, the DCCF may determine that the requested data is already being collected from a Data Source or that a prior subscription to a Data Source may be modified to in addition satisfy the requirements of the new data request from a Data Consumer. This status is used in clause 5A.3 to deliver data to the Data Consumer and notification endpoints.

For persisting event exposure subscriptions for long-lived data collection, the DCCF may subscribe to the UDM to receive event notifications even if a Data Source that serves a UE changes.

The DCCF may subscribe to the NRF to receive event notifications if a Data Source changes (e.g. because of a NF life-cycle event).

question 10654,What happens when continuous less important data from the UPF to the RAN causes congestion?,UPF requests more transport layer resource,UPF drops the data,UPF buffers the data,UPF signals congestion to the AF,,,,,"6.13	Solution #13: DL data handling

6.13.1	Key Issue mapping

The solution applies to Key Issue #5 Differentiated PDU Set Handling.

6.13.2	Description

When the RAN congestion happens, in order to prioritize the transmission of the more important data (e.g. I frame), the RAN can drop the less important DL data (e.g. B frame) to the UE. During the congestion period, the continuous less importance data from the UPF to the RAN may cause the RAN more congested and waste the transport layer resource between the RAN and the UPF. The UPF can also drop some less important data to the RAN when RAN is congested. Besides, the existing FAR has supported to block or buffer chose data at the UPF.

Hence, the solution proposes to make UPF not to transmit the less important DL data to the RAN when the RAN congestion happens."

	This enables the gNB to know whether it can locally discard PDUs of a PDU Set if it knows that it will fail to properly deliver the complete PDU Set.

e)	The GTP-U extension header type can be encoded so that intermediate UPFs/GTP-U entities pass the header on to the final GTP-U endpoint even if the intermediate GTP-U entities do not understand that GTP-U extension header).

	To enable smooth operation with legacy RAN nodes, it is anticipated that the GTP-U extension header would be encoded as 'comprehension not required'.

	The relevant extract from the GTP-U specification, clause 5.2.1 of TS 29.281 [16] is copied below:

question 10670,What information can be used to assist the CDRX enhancement?,Number of periodic bursts per second,Jitter information,Traffic periodicity,PDU set size,All of the above,,,,"The following information is useful for the NG-RAN to enhance and configure CDRX: application packet periodicity and periodicity changes, and application packet jitter statistics (e.g. jitter range defined by minimum/maximum around the mean application packet periodicity), all per application flow. We discuss each of these parameters as follows.



6.58.2.2	Application packet periodicity

The application packet periodicity (i.e. generation rate at the application) can be used to enhance CDRX at the NG-RAN, such that the CDRX cycle length is matched to the inter-arrival time of the application packets. An application packet can be, for instance, a video frame with periodicity 1/(60 fps). Thus, more power could be saved at the UE while ensuring a short traffic delay, since the UE awake time could follow closely the traffic arrival. Furthermore, information about changes in this periodicity is also needed, e.g. when the application employs rate adaptation."

4.1	Introduction

In computing, virtualisation encompasses a number of different techniques to create a virtual, or software, version of a computing device. Examples of devices and systems which may be virtualised include hardware platforms, memory, storage or a network. The present document primarily addresses the security of Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) as defined by ETSI. However, the security threat, risks and mitigations are applicable to any other similar virtualisation approach. In the context of a 3GPP network, NFV refers to the deployment of Network Functions (NFs) as software modules which run on 'off the shelf' computing hardware. This contrasts with the traditional deployment of 3GPP network components as specialized hardware devices. Implementation of the 5G Service Based Architecture (SBA) relies on the use of NFV, among other technologies.

The OTA transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability of the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals in its non-linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the transmitter unit via the RDN and antenna array from a co-located base station. The requirement applies during the transmitter ON period and the transmitter transient period.

The requirement applies at each RIB supporting transmission in the operating band.

The transmitter intermodulation level is the total radiated power of the intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into the CLTA.

question 10731,What is a possible charging option during an active session if media types change?,The media types cannot change during an active session,No additional charges apply if media types change during an active session,Only the calling party can change the media types during an active session,Different rating may be applied based on the changed media types,,,,,"During an active session, media types can change (e.g. audio changed to data) and shall be charged for appropriately. It is thus necessary to be able to detect a change of media during a session so that different rating may be applied.

It should also be noted that during a multi-party session, normally if the charged party drops off the session, all components being charged to that party should drop. But it is foreseeable to support a service option that allows the charged party to continue to be charged even if they drop off the session. The charging rules should support this option."
question 10732,What is a potential benefit of using the 'continuous' mode for LP-WUS monitoring?,Shorter downlink latency,Reduced power consumption,Improved coverage,Enhanced system information reception,None of the above,,,,"Currently, paging monitoring in RRC_IDLE/INACTIVE mode is based on the configured I-DRX, as well as PEI is also designed as 'duty-cycled' associated with legacy PO. The specification impact for 'continuous' and 'duty-cycled' depends on the detailed design. While, a potential benefit of 'continuous' is shorter downlink latency. That is, since the UE monitors the downlink continuously the downlink latency could potentially be shorter.

Due to the transition time to start up the main receiver however, LP-WUR operation may always have worse latency performance than legacy, i.e., comparing to legacy continuous monitoring or DRX. 'Continuous' could still provide shorter downlink latency compared to 'duty-cycled', comparing at the same UE energy consumption reduction gain. This however depends on the UE procedure triggered by LP-WUS and the LP-WUS payload content and size."

The geometrical part of the spatial map may be represented as a sparse or dense point cloud or a mesh. The mapping process may be performed either at runtime or offline. The spatial map is then used at runtime to relocalize and thus register the AR device by matching the visual features extracted from the current captured frames with spatial features stored in the spatial map. The spatial mapping approach described herein is one of well-known keyframe-based SLAM techniques [58]."

question 10735,What is an interworking key management record (InterKMRec) used for?,To enable secure InterSD messaging between a MC UE and a non-3GPP system,To authenticate signalling packets,To manage LMR security mechanisms,To encrypt interworking media,,,,,"11.2.3	Interworking key management enablement

To support interworking key management with a non-3GPP system (i.e. InterSD messaging), an interworking MC UE may require provisioning of an interworking key management record (InterKMRec) that supports the secure transfer of InterSD messages. Generally speaking, an InterKMRec provides initial key management parameters needed to send, receive, address, protect, or otherwise interpret InterSD messages passed between an interworking 3GPP MC UE and the non-3GPP interworking system (e.g. interworking key management addressing, interworking key management identifiers, interworking key management root keys, or other interworking key management related parameters).

The InterKMRec is provided from the MC KMS to the interworking MC UE during MC user key management authorization.

The format of an InterKMRec is shown in figure 11.2.3-1 and consists of a Primary InterKMRec ID, a Secondary InterKMRec ID, and the InterKMRec Payload."
question 10736,What is associated with a separate multicast address for each group and group combination?,Special DNN/S-NSSAI,TSCTSF,AF session with QoS service,UE-to-UE traffic,LADN-based method,,,,"Each group and group combination is associated with a separate multicast address.

Application sends traffic to a multicast address depending on what group(s) it wants to target. This allows an application to send a single packet reaching multiple destinations and also multiple groups.

The network configures a QoS policy for each UE where a multicast address is associated with a QoS level. The QoS level is set according to the QoS requirements for the group(s) the multicast address represents. Corresponding QoS Flow(s) is activated on each UE's PDU Session, as needed.

Application sends one UL copy.

question 10938,What is the impact of further UE peak rate reduction on coverage?,Coverage loss is expected,Coverage impact is similar to UE bandwidth reduction,Coverage impact depends on the UE implementation,No coverage loss is expected,,,,,"7.2.3	Analysis of performance impacts

Peak data rate:

Reducing the UE bandwidth leads to peak data rate reduction, but the reduced peak data rate can still fulfill the targeted data rate in Rel-18. In TDD, with 5 MHz UE bandwidth (for all BW options), the achievable peak data rate for UL or DL can be less than 10 Mbps depending on the TDD pattern.

Coverage:

For all BW options, there is link performance impact for SIB1 PDSCH if the bandwidth allocation for SIB1 PDSCH exceeds 5 MHz. However, in all scenarios except for 4 GHz with 24 dBm PSD, there is no or negligible coverage impact for SIB1 PDSCH even if the bandwidth allocation for SIB1 PDSCH exceeds 5 MHz.

Furthermore, for BW1/BW2, there is link performance degradation for PDCCH due to reduced maximum AL in a 5-MHz CORESET, and for PBCH (30 kHz SCS).

For a more detailed description of the coverage impacts, see clause 8.2.4.

Although the gain of passive antennas may vary somewhat, the gain variation is in the order of a few dBs. The instantaneous gain of an AAS BS may be much larger. However AAS unwanted emissions requirements are defined as TRP, since TRP impacts co-existence properties.

In order to relate the EIRP values in the specifications to TRP, a fixed assumption has been made on the gain of a typical passive BS antenna.

Thus, the maximum TRP can be estimated using the following formulas:

TRP limit per antenna:	PTRP, antenna = PEIRP - GAnt 

E-UTRA TRP limit per cell or per BS:	PTRP =PTRP,antenna + 9dB

UTRA TRP limit per cell or per BS:	PTRP =PTRP,antenna + 6dB

The maximum separation is also a parameter which is difficult to agree as it depends on a number of things, a fixed antenna array may have a separation of up to 0.9λ (at its maximum operational frequency). In previous studies [xx] it has been assumed for BS antenna simulations that a fully steerable antenna array has a separation of 0.5-0.7λ to avoid grating lobes.

For example:

DRX parameters that control the UE active time (e.g. On duration and the Inactivity time) can be configured to consider the PDB, jitter range and the validity time of the PDU Set [2]. The validity time indicates that the UE must remain active beyond the PDB even if the number of retransmissions has reached its limit. Therefore, the On duration can be opportunistically configured to prevent the UE entering in sleep mode before the validity time of the PDU Set is expired.

PDCCH adaptation parameters (e.g. SSSGs duration and timer) that control the PDCCH monitoring frequency can be configured to consider the PDB, jitter range and the validity time of the PDU Set [2].

A UE may adopt the PSM for reducing its power consumption. That mode is similar to power-off, but the UE remains registered with the network and there is no need to re-attach or re-establish PDN connections. A UE in PSM is not 



immediately reachable for mobile terminating services. A UE using PSM is available for mobile terminating services during the time it is in connected mode and for the period of an Active Time that is after the connected mode. The connected mode is caused by a mobile originated event like data transfer or signalling, e.g. after a periodic TAU/RAU procedure. PSM is therefore intended for UEs that are expecting only infrequent mobile originating and terminating services and that can accept a corresponding latency in the mobile terminating communication.

For mobile terminated data while a UE is in PSM, the functions for High latency communication may be used as described in clause 4.5.7."

In order to integrate real-time media into AR scenes, a Media Access Function (MAF) provides the ability to access media and adds it to the AR scene. The MAF instantiates and manages Media Pipelines. A media pipeline typically handles content of an attribute/component of an object/mesh that is part of the scene graph. The media pipeline produces content in the format indicated by the scene description file. For real-time media, the formatted frame is then pushed into the circular buffer. Media Pipelines are typically highly optimized and customized for the type and format of media that is being fetched. Typically, for one scene, multiple media decoders of the same media type are needed to run in parallel. If the media decoders share the same hardware decoding platform on the UE, the MAF may also coordinate the different instances of media decoders to optimise the use of the hardware platform thus avoiding negative effects of resource competition or possible synchronization issues. MPEG-I Video Decoding Interface (ISO/IEC 23090-13 [6]) is an example specification that may fulfil this task of coordination. More information is available in clause 4.6.6.

15.4.1	General

The aim of this function is to reduce operational expenses through energy savings.

The function allows, for example in a deployment where capacity boosters can be distinguished from cells providing basic coverage, to optimize energy consumption enabling the possibility for an E-UTRA or NR cell providing additional capacity via single or dual connectivity, to be switched off when its capacity is no longer needed and to be re-activated on a need basis, or to support various adaptation techniques in time, frequency, spatial and power domains.

15.4.2	Solution description

15.4.2.1	Intra-system energy saving

The solution builds upon the possibility for the NG-RAN node owning a capacity booster cell to autonomously decide to switch-off such cell to lower energy consumption (inactive state). The decision is typically based on cell load information, consistently with configured information. The switch-off decision may also be taken by O&M."

The Mobile Station Roaming Number (MSRN) is used to route calls directed to an MS. On request from the Gateway MSC via the HLR it is temporarily allocated to an MS by the VLR with which the MS is registered; it addresses the Visited MSC collocated with the assigning VLR. More than one MSRN may be assigned simultaneously to an MS.

The MSRN is passed by the HLR to the Gateway MSC to route calls to the MS.

The Mobile Station Roaming Number for PSTN/ISDN routing shall have the same structure as international E.164 numbers in the area in which the roaming number is allocated, i.e.:

question 11189,What is the purpose of the Marker bit (M) in an RTP packet?,To indicate the start and end of a NAL unit,To differentiate the importance of PDU Sets,To mark significant events such as frame boundaries,To identify the PDUs of one PDU Set,To indicate the sequence number of the packet,,,,"could be used by 5GS to identify the PDUs of one PDU Set, or to differentiate the importance of PDU Sets. For example, as described in RFC 3550 [9], the Marker bit (M) is intended to allow significant events such as frame boundaries to be marked in the packet stream. And for H.264 encoded video, as described in RFC 6184 [12], NRI with the value of [0,3] indicates the relative transport priority of the RTP packet, 0 indicates the NAL unit can be discarded without risking the integrity of the reference pictures, while the RTP packets of an I frame should have the NRI value of 3. S bit and E bit indicate the start and end of a NAL unit which is fragmented into several RTP packets. The RTP header also contains sequence number which indicates the packet sequence at RTP layer. With the RTP layer sequence number, 5GS can identify the sequence of PDU Set and the packet sequence within a PDU Set, thus can allocate ""PDU Set Sequence number (SN)"" and ""PDU SN within a PDU Set""."

PDU-Set Sequence number

	Rationale: enables NG-RAN to identify PDU(s) that belong to a new/different/particular PDU Set and to evaluate the associated information.

2.	Size of the PDU-Set (number of bytes) enabling NG-RAN to assess whether delivery of the PDU-Set is feasible. If re-ordering of PDUs prior to N6 is assumed as possible, the 'size of the PDU-Set information' needs to be included in the RTP extension header of each packet. Each RTP packet carries the PDU Set size of the entire PDU Set.

3.	PDU-Set inter-dependencies, e.g. Late PDU-Set delivery indication.

Rationale : Dependent on the type of content carried by a PDU-Set within a QoS Flow, a late PDU-Set delivery, i.e. delivery non-compliant with the required latency may be still beneficial from the application perspective. Hence it enables NG-RAN to improve the resource usage while considering benefits for the QoE.

Thus, the PELR defines an upper bound for a rate of non congestion related packet losses. The purpose of the PELR is to allow for appropriate link layer protocol configurations (e.g. RLC and HARQ in E-UTRAN). For a certain QCI the value of the PELR is the same in uplink and downlink.

The stipulated PDB and PELR as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 for QCI1 intended for Conversational Voice services results in that on each link 99 percent of the packets will be successfully delivered over an LTE air interface with a maximum delay of less than 80ms with a confidence level of 98 percent.

The QoS Parameter Notification control indicates whether notifications are requested from the NG-RAN when the ""GFBR can no longer (or can again) be guaranteed"" for a QoS Flow during the lifetime of the QoS Flow.

In the 5GS, each GBR QoS Flow shall be associated with an AW (Averaging Window). The AW represents the duration over which the GFBR and MFBR shall be calculated (e.g. in the (R)AN, UPF, UE). The AW may also be signalled together with a standardized 5QI to the (R)AN, UE and UPF, and if it is received, it shall be used instead of 



the default value. In the Table 5.7.4-1(Standardized 5QI to QoS characteristics mapping) of the TS 23.501, the Default AW is 2000 ms."

For the syntax description and the use of this identifier in RANAP signalling, see 3GPP TS 25.413 [17].

12.4	RNC Identifier

An RNC node is uniquely identified by its RNC Identifier (RNC-Id). The RNC-Id of an RNC is used in the UTRAN, in a GERAN which is operating in GERAN Iu mode and between them. A BSC which is part of a GERAN operating in Iu mode is uniquely identified by its RNC Identifier (RNC-Id). The RNC-Id of a BSC is used in a GERAN which is operating in GERAN Iu mode, in the UTRAN and between them. RNC-Id together with the PLMN identifier globally identifies the RNC. The RNC-Id on its own or the RNC-Id together with the PLMN-Id is used as the RNC identifier in the UTRAN Iub, Iur and Iu interfaces. The SRNC-Id is the RNC-Id of the SRNC. The C-RNC-Id is the RNC-Id of the controlling RNC. The D-RNC-Id is the RNC Id of the drift RNC.

The upper layer (e.g. Ranging layer) initiates the ranging session by sending ranging request/response message (i.e., Ranging/Sidelink Positioning initiation procedure) and performs the ranging parameter coordination between the UEs, and the upper layer provides the ranging configuration to the AS layer. The ranging parameter includes the Ranging role (Reference UE or Target UE), one time or period ranging, ranging for distance or direction measurement or both, ranging QoS/accuracy.

Ranging/Sidelink Positioning Protocol (RSPP) procedure is performed e.g., for Ranging Capability Transfer, Ranging Assistance Data Transfer, and Ranging Location Information Transfer between the UEs. The details of the RSPP procedure are expected to be developed and defined in RAN WGs.

The lower layer (e.g. AS layer) transmits or receives Ranging signalling and performs measurements according to the ranging configuration;"

Reference PDU Set SN (RPS-SN): optional parameter used for PDU Sets that depend on a more important (Reference) PDU Set and need to be transmitted only if the Reference PDU Set has been successfully transmitted.

The use of PS-SN, PDU-SN and LPF allows the network entities (UPF or NG-RAN) to determine the PDU Set boundaries, as well as any loss of PDUs. Upon detection of a lost PDU, the network entity can decide to drop the remaining PDUs belonging to the same PDU Set e.g. based on the PHT.

Similarly, the use of RPS-SN allows the network entities (UPF or NG-RAN) to drop all dependent PDU Sets if the Reference PDU Set has not been transmitted successfully."

The UE decides to switch the data traffic transferred over the untrusted non-3GPP access of the MA PDU Session to the detected trusted non-3GPP access network.

5.	For this purpose, the UE initiates a 5G registration over trusted non-3GPP access and sends a Registration Request to the same AMF. The Registration Request contains a Non-3GPP path switch indication (e.g. either a new registration type = ""Non-3GPP path switch"" or a registration type = ""Initial"" plus a new IE), which indicates that the registration over trusted non-3GPP access is required for switching the data traffic of an MA PDU Session to another non-3GPP access path. The Non-3GPP path switch indication indicates to AMF that the existing registration via untrusted non-3GPP access should not be released until the path switch is completed."

For new application traffic flow which may have UE's new IP address as source IP address, the new SEALDD server sends it directly to the new VAL server.

For SEALDD server relocation, the inter-SEALDD server communication via SEALDD-E reference point is needed, which transfers the SEALDD context from the old SEALDD server to the new SEALDD server. 

The following procedures detail the EDGEAPP ACT part between old SEALDD server (i.e. S-EAS) and new SEALDD server (i.e. T-EAS) as described in 3GPP TS 23.558 [10], clause 8.8.2.2 to clause 8.8.2.6. Also, a high-level flow is provided to show the scenario used in EDN."

IETF-defined STIR (Secure Telephone Identity Revisited) is considered one of the most promising technologies to combat unwanted robocalls, while SHAKEN (Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using tokens) framework provides a mechanism to implement STIR to authenticate calls. The STIR/SHAKEN works for authenticating and thus proving that a call has not been spoofed, but it does not determine caller intent. This means that bad actors may continue making unwanted calls by registering telephone numbers, which, as long as registered, are authentically theirs.

5	Recommendations

In this study, we have identified the need to define a network based solution which aims at verifying the reported UE location information.

The verification should be performed independently from the location information reported by UE.

The UE location information for the study is considered verified if the reported UE location is consistent with the network based assessment to within 5-10 km (similar to terrestrial network macro cell size), enabling country discrimination and selection of an appropriate core network in order to support all the regulatory services (i.e. emergency call, lawful intercept, public warning, charging/billing)."

TAE is only applicable for NR BS transmitting from multiple antennas via MIMO, CA, or combination of them.

However, in ATG system, BS transmits signals from the ground to the air. Generally, these are only the main path signals, and few multipath signals. Thus, it’s unnecessary to specify the MIMO TAE requirements for ATG BS. In addition, CA is not supported for ATG in Rel-18. As a result, no TAE requirements need to be developed for ATG BS.

In the case that there are more than one PDU Session Types for a 5G VN group, the AF can manipulate the order of the requested PDU Session Type in 5G VN group data via Nnef_ParameterProvision_Create/Nnef_ParameterProvision_Update to influence the setting with precedence value at PCF when generating URSP rules, this is to ensure that URSP rule for the requested PDU Session Type has higher precedence value than the URSP rules for other PDU Session Type(s) of the 5G VN group. If the PCF/SMF receives the requests to update the PDU Session type for an ongoing PDU Session and the requested PDU Session type is authorized for the UE or 5G VN group, then SMF sends PDU Session Release COMMAND to UE indicating that re-establishment of the PDU Session is required, so the UE will re-establish the PDU Session using URSP rules for the requested PDU Session Type which has higher precedence value than the URSP rules for other PDU Session Type(s) of the 5G VN group."

The following principles are concluded for normative work:

A 5G VN group may be served by a single SMF (set) or different SMF (set)s. Set functionality is used to support SMF redundancy for reliability of the 5G VN group communication:

The associations between one or more SMF Sets and the DNN, S-NSSAI of the associated 5G VN group is registered and discovered in NRF per existing mechanisms (SMF registers the DNN+S-NSSAI it supports).

The SMFs that registered to associate with the DNN, S-NSSAI of the associated 5G VN group should be available in the service area of the 5G VN group.

For UPFs served by a single SMF Set, N19-based forwarding, N6-based forwarding and local switch as per Rel-17 can be used with the following clarifications:"

In 5GS, it is also possible for the UE trajectory forecast to be provided directly to the core network by external server via NEF or via NWDAF. In this hypothesis, the AMF will push coverage information over NAS to the UE supporting the feature.

It is also possible that coverage information can be provided for any RAT type, not only satellite NG-RAN.

question 11665,Which NF can request the UDM to deregister the IP-SM-GW from the UDM?,HSS,SMSF,SMF,AMF,NWDAF,,,,"1.	The IP-SM-GW deregisters its address in HSS (IMS) via Sh as defined in 3GPP TS 23.204 [18]. If the EPS-UDR is used, the HSS (IMS) removes the IP-SM-GW address from the EPS-UDR.

2.	The HSS forwards the IP-SM-GW deregistration request to the UDM using a Nudm_UECM_IPSMGWDeregistration request. If the 5GS-UDR is used, the UDM removes the IP-SM-GW address from the 5GS-UDR.

3.	The UDM confirms the IP-SM-GW deregistration with a successful Nudm_UECM_IPSMGWDeregistration response.

4 - 5.	If the UDM receives a request for routing information from the SMS-GMSC via MAP or Diameter, the UDM checks if there is an IP-SM-GW address registered for the UE. If the 5GS-UDR is used, the UDM queries the 5GS-UDR to read the registered SMSF and/or IP-SM-GW, if any. If an IP-SM-GW address is not present, the UDM follows the MT SMS procedures defined in clause 4.13.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [5] and 3GPP TS 23.040 [17].

Since a UE is configured with standard channel bandwidth, there are no issues with UE performance degradation relative to minimum requirements and all the regulatory requirements can be met as per legacy operation. The ACS and the blocking performance are not affected, hence there will be no impact on the network planning. The gNB has to support the irregular channel BW because from the network perspective RBs are scheduled across the whole spectrum block.

question 11870,Which method of transferring coverage data would minimize the impact on the MME/AMF?,User plane transfer,O&M transfer,NGAP/S1AP transfer,NAS transfer,SBI transfer,,,,"

Since it has been shown that ephemeris data can be very inefficient when it comes to calculation of coverage periods and could be less accurate and with other drawbacks as described in clause 7.4.1, the SIB solution for ephemeris data transfer could be ruled out. That leaves NAS transfer to a UE (included in 4 solutions) or user plane transfer from an external server or DCAF according to Solution #15. NAS transfer will impact an AMF and MME in terms of extra NAS signalling and support for obtaining (e.g. via O&M or from an external server) and transferring the coverage map data, but in case both AMF/MME and UE are requiring satellite coverage data, it will insure that same information is shared and synchronized on both sides. It will also be interesting if no SMS nor IP are available User plane transfer can avoid MME/AMF impacts in the case of the DCAF solution or reduce the impacts in the case of user plane transfer from an external server, where the impact is to provide a URI for the external server plus information to be included by the UE in a request to the external server."

From this perspective, the 5G Core security standards provide two means to protect communication in and with the 5G Core. On the network layer, there is the NDS/IP framework, relying on IPsec, specified in TS 33.210 [5]. On the transport layer there is TLS for which the profile is also captured in TS 33.210 [5]. Both security protocols provide integrity, confidentiality, and replay protection. NDS/IP is applicable to all interfaces involving the 5G Core since they are all IP based. TLS is on the other hand applicable to all service-based ones since they are HTTP based. IPsec has the advantage of providing topology hiding but TLS whenever applicable can alleviate the dependency on perimeter security should the IPsec tunnel be terminated at the perimeter. With TLS the operator can further push the protection end points deeper within the perimeter."
