There can be up to 15 DL and UL non-anchor carriers configured in a new NB-IoT SIB, used by paging, RAR, or SC-PTM, each identified by its centre frequency. For paging purposes, POs are distributed across the non-anchor carriers in a configurable uneven manner so that the eNB can decide what paging load each carrier should have. For random access, each non-anchor UL carrier has a probability with which the UE may randomly select it for Msg1&3, and corresponds to a DL carrier for Msg2&4; or for ordered random access the carrier for Msg1&3 is indicated by DCI. Contention free random access is supported for NPDCCH ordered random access.","To reduce the time and UE power required to transfer larger messages in more favourable coverage, the range of transport block sizes (TBS) the NB-IoT UE can support is increased from a maximum of 680 bits DL and 1000 bits UL to 2536 bits on both links.

The 3GPP network shall be able to provide priority treatment to an MPS-subscribed UE before the MPS application service invocation (e.g., priority treatment for the default and IMS signalling bearers establishment based on a subscription profile).","

Providing priority treatment to MPS-subscribed UEs during attachment/registration for radio access and network connectivity before the MPS application service session invocation requests improves the probability of an MPS session request being successful. This involves providing priority treatment for the signalling during the UE attachment for radio access and network connectivity based on a subscription profile. Prior to accessing subscription related information in the network, subscription related information stored in the UE is used, e.g., membership in the special access class required to be reserved for MPS use as per 3GPP TS 22.011 [6], or the special Access Identity used for MPS as per 3GPP TS 22.261 [7]. Without such priority treatment, a Service User’s UE might fail to gain radio access network and CN connectivity which in turn means that there is no access to the MPS application services (Voice, Video, and Data). Priority treatment before MPS session request increases the probability of successful MPS session establishment and any associated process for the Service User authorization (e.g., credential collection).

question 8950,Which high level deployment configuration supports distributed algorithms for scheduling and interference management of V2V traffic? [3GPP Release 14],Configuration 1,Configuration 2,Both configurations,Neither configuration,,,,Standards overview,"In ""Configuration 1"" scheduling and interference management of V2V traffic is supported based on distributed algorithms (Mode 4) implemented between the vehicles. As mentioned earlier the distributed algorithm is based on sensing with semi-persistent transmission. Additionally, a new mechanism where resource allocation is dependent on geographical information is introduced. Such a mechanism counters near far effect arising due to in-band emissions.

3GPP

Release 14	30	3GPP TR 21.914 V14.0.0 (2018-05)",Finally for distributed scheduling (a.k.a. Mode 4) a sensing with semi-persistent transmission based mechanism was introduced. V2V traffic from a device is mostly periodic in nature. This was utilized to sense congestion on a resource and estimate future congestion on that resource. Based on estimation resources were booked. This technique optimizes the use of the channel by enhancing resource separation between transmitters that are using overlapping resources.

[3GPP Release 14],To transmit control signaling over the Uu interface,To enhance resource separation between transmitters,To provide time synchronization using GNSS,To handle high-speed communication between vehicles,,,,Standards overview,"

Secondly a new arrangement of scheduling assignment and data resources has been agreed. The arrangement is illustrated in Figure 7.2-2 and is designed to enhance the system level performance under high density while meeting the latency requirements of V2V. Scheduling assignments (SA or PSCCH) are transmitted in sub-channels using specific RBs across time. Data transmissions associated with said scheduling assignments are occupying adjacent RBs in the same subframe. Note that another variant where SA and associated data transmissions are not necessarily transmitted on adjacent RBs has also been standardized.","In ""Configuration 2"" scheduling and interference management of V2V traffic is assisted by eNBs (a.k.a. Mode 3) via control signaling over the Uu interface. The eNodeB will assign the resources being used for V2V signaling in a dynamic manner.

question 9052,What is Small Data Transmission (SDT)? [3GPP Release 18],A procedure allowing data and/or signalling transmission in RRC_SUSPEND state.,A procedure allowing data and/or signalling transmission in RRC_CONNECTED state.,A procedure allowing data and/or signalling transmission in RRC_IDLE state.,A procedure allowing data and/or signalling transmission in RRC_RELEASE state.,A procedure allowing data and/or signalling transmission while remaining in RRC_INACTIVE state.,,,Standards specifications,"

Small data transmission procedures have been defined in 3GPP Rel-17 for SDT-RA for both two step and four step RA during RRC Inactive with a view of providing power saving opportunities and reducing overhead signalling. Without well performing UE beam correspondence support, wide usage of RRC_INACTIVE and Small Data Transmission may not be feasible in practical FR2 deployments. To enable efficient use of RRC_INACTIVE and Small Data Transmission in FR2 deployments to save UE power with reasonable latencies it is important to develop FR2 UE beam correspondence requirements for RRC_INACTIVE in Rel-18.","

Small Data Transmission (SDT) is a procedure allowing data and/or signalling transmission while remaining in RRC_INACTIVE state (i.e. without transitioning to RRC_CONNECTED state). SDT is enabled on a radio bearer basis and can be initiated either by the UE in case of MO-SDT (Mobile Originated SDT) or by the network in case of MT-SDT (Mobile Terminated SDT). MO-SDT is initiated by the UE only if less than or equal to a configured amount of UL data awaits transmission across all radio bearers for which SDT is enabled, the DL RSRP is above a configured threshold, and a valid SDT resource is available as specified in clause 5.27.1 of TS 38.321 [6]. MT-SDT is initiated by the network with an indication to the UE in a paging message when DL data awaits transmission for radio bearers configured for SDT; based on the indication, the UE initiates the MT-SDT only if the DL RSRP is above a configured threshold as specified in clause 5.27.1 of TS 38.321 [6]. When MT-SDT is initiated by the UE, a resume cause indicating MT-SDT is included in the RRCResumeRequest/RRCResumeRequest1. Maximum duration the SDT procedure can last is dictated by a SDT failure detection timer that is configured by the network (see clause 6.2.2 of TS 38.331 [12]).

In the context of Release-17, 3GPP work is ongoing in order to identify the integration of edge processing in 5G systems. 3GPP TR 23.748 [28] defines the necessary modifications to 5G system architecture to enhance Edge Computing. This work is currently in study phase, defining key issues and scope for Release-17. Specifically, this study is investigating mechanisms to discover connectivity to available Edge Computing resources (e.g. using DNS), mobility improvements for both UE consuming Edge Computing services and for Edge Application Servers, and for network capability exposure towards the Edge Application Server. ",The present document is a technical report capturing the study on enhanced architecture for enabling edge applications over 3GPP networks. The study bases the enhancements on the work done in 3GPP TS 23.558 [2] and takes into consideration other related work done within and outside 3GPP i.e. ETSI MEC [3] and GSMA OP [4].

question 9077,Which architecture has a CHF instance and the Edge Enablement Server (EES) located in the same Service Deployment Cluster? [3GPP Release 18],Centralized CHF deployment,Local/Edge CHF deployment,Converged charging architecture,Distributed CTF architecture,,,,Standards specifications,"

There is an option of distributing CCS functions in a distributed way by making available, a CHF instance and the  Edge Enablement Server (EES) is located in  the same Service Deployment Cluster. On this case the CHF instance selected may be the one physically closer to the EES. Therefore, the charging events would be generated through the CTF towards the CHF that is available at the Edge. This is depicted in in TS 32.257 [57] clause 4.2.3. Furthermore, there are other distributed models that can be used, for instance, the availability of NF(CTF), instead of using an EES, in the Service Deployment Cluster. ","The edge enabler architecture is specified in 3GPP TS 23.558 [11] which supports Edge Application Servers (EAS) deployed at EDN with enabler capabilities like Application Context Relocation.

It is required to investigate the impact of edge deployments of V2X application architecture considering the Edge enabler architecture. The following open issues can be studied:

a.	Whether and how V2X application architecture supports the edge enabler architecture specified in 3GPP TS 23.558 [11]."
question 9091,"Which aspect of the 5G system covers network slicing, network capability exposure, scalability, and diverse mobility, security, efficient content delivery, and migration and interworking? [3GPP Release 18]",Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB),Critical Communications (CC),Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC),Massive Internet of Things (mIoT),Flexible network operations,,,Standards specifications,"

Unlike previous 3GPP systems that attempted to provide a 'one size fits all' system, the 5G system is expected to be able to provide optimized support for a variety of different services, different traffic loads, and different end user communities. Various industry white papers, most notably, the NGMN 5G White Paper [2], describe a multi-faceted 5G system capable of simultaneously supporting multiple combinations of reliability, latency, throughput, positioning, and availability. This technology revolution is achievable with the introduction of new technologies, both in access and the core, such as flexible, scalable assignment of network resources. In addition to increased flexibility and optimization, a 5G system needs to support stringent KPIs for latency, reliability, throughput, etc. Enhancements in the radio interface contribute to meeting these KPIs as do enhancements in the core network, such as network slicing, in-network caching and hosting services closer to the end points.","

Network slicing is one of the key features of 5G which allows Mobile Network Operators to provision logical networks to serve a specific service or service category, or to serve customers with specific service requirements. Network slicing standardization has progressed in various different 3GPP Working Groups. Specification related to this feature includes architecture, orchestration and management, network resource models, capability management and exposure. The Key Issues studied in the present document point to a need to extend the 5GMS architecture in order to take advantage of network slicing when delivering 5G Media Streaming services."

[3GPP Release 18],To enable the user to establish and maintain several connections simultaneously,To support the development of multimedia services,To notify the home environment of ME changes,"To enable control, creation, and subscription of service capabilities and services",,,,Standards specifications,"Signalling flows for the notification of application detection information are presented in 3GPP TS 29.513 [7].

NOTE:	When the NF service consumer receives the notifications for multiple applications, the NF service consumer (e.g. the PCF for the UE) can determine which logic to apply (e.g. which AM policy to apply) based on local configuration and operator policy.

In this release of the specification application detection applies only to the application(s) with IP traffic.","Nevertheless, it is important that 3GPP investigates how resistance to radio jamming is further enhanced. For example, an attacker would be deterred when the probability of being detected is high and especially if the detection solution results in the attacker's asset information to be revealed, e.g. attacker's location.

question 9444,What is the purpose of the Intra-CU topological redundancy procedure?

For the enhancement of load balancing, Rel-17 IAB further introduces inter-donor topological redundancy. For this purpose, the IAB-MT executes the NR DC procedure to concurrently connect to two IAB-donors. The collocated IAB-DU can establish F1 with either of these two IAB-donors. Inter-donor topological redundancy also interconnects two IAB-topologies where the dual-connected IAB-node assumes the role of the boundary node. F1 and non-F1 traffic of the dual-connected IAB-node and its descendent nodes can be gradually migrated between the two paths via either the MN’s or the SN’s IAB-donor-DU. The XnAP IAB Transport Migration Management/Modification procedures are used for the coordination between MN and SN IAB-donors for this traffic migration. The boundary node applies BAP header rewriting for all traffic that passes through both IAB-topologies. The MN and SN further coordinate the use of radio resources used on the parent links and child links of the dual-connecting IAB-node.",Inter-donor topological redundancy

question 9754,"In a remote interference scenario, how are victim and aggressor gNBs grouped? [3GPP Release 18]",By their geographical locations,By their signal strengths,By their set IDs,By their TDD DL-UL configurations,By their atmospheric conditions,,,Standards specifications,"

A remote interference scenario may involve a number of victim and aggressor cells, where the gNBs execute Remote Interference Management (RIM) coordination on behalf of their respective cells. Aggressor and victim gNBs can be grouped into semi-static sets, where each cell is assigned a set ID, and is configured with a RIM Reference Signal (RIM-RS) and the radio resources associated with the set ID. Each aggressor gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs and each victim gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs, whereas each cell can have at most one victim set ID and one aggressor set ID. Consequently, each gNB can be an aggressor and a victim at the same time.","To mitigate remote interference, the network enables RIM frameworks for coordination between victim and aggressor gNBs. The coordination communication in RIM frameworks can be wireless- or backhaul-based. The backhaul-based RIM framework uses a combination of wireless and backhaul communication, while in the wireless framework, the communication is purely wireless.

RRM measurement relaxation: The legacy LTE-MTC UE behavior requires the UE to measure on the serving cell and evaluate the cell selection criterion at least every DRX cycle. The wake-up signal (WUS) introduced in Rel-15 would allow the UE to sleep for multiple paging cycles and wake up to receive paging after a configurable time duration, but the UE power saving gain from WUS cannot be fully utilized since the UE is still required to wake up for measurements. Therefore, an RRM measurement relaxation is introduced in Rel-16, which allows the UE meet the requirements using a longer measurement cycle to save power, where the cycle is configurable under certain conditions.","8.	Multiband relaxation framework enhancement: Based on RAN5 LS MBR framework was modified. REL15 retains original MBR concept but introduced a relaxation cap.

When the RAN congestion happens, in order to prioritize the transmission of the more important data (e.g. I frame), the RAN can drop the less important DL data (e.g. B frame) to the UE. During the congestion period, the continuous less importance data from the UPF to the RAN may cause the RAN more congested and waste the transport layer resource between the RAN and the UPF. The UPF can also drop some less important data to the RAN when RAN is congested.

To control the reporting rates, there are two possible way. First one is that the SMF can provide different bitrate span to the RAN, e.g. the three level bitrate span are 0~500kbps, 500~2500kbps, above 2500kpb ~ Ͼ. Only after the available mean bitrate is changed from one bitrate level to another bitrate level, the RAN can generate the non-GBR QoS Notification Control Report Message. The second on is that the SMF can provide different bitrate changes percentage to RAN, only after the available mean bitrate is changed UP/Down above the change percentage, the RAN will generate the non-GBR QoS Notification Control Report message. One example of 3 level bitrate change percentage can be 50%, 100%, 200%.","

question 10033,How can user pose information be represented?,Cartesian coordinate system,Translation matrix,Rotation matrix,All of the above,None of the above,,,,"

The device representing a user’s pose moves continuously, and if the device is worn on the user’s head, it is assumed that he or she frequently turns their head around. A set of position and direction information is only meaningful at a certain moment in time. Since the device reports the user pose at around a frequency of 1 KHz, any pose information would need to include a timestamp to specify when it was measured or created. A pose corrector (e.g., ATW and LSR) in a server may estimate the user’s future pose, whilst a pose corrector in a device may correct the received rendered image to fit the latest user pose. ","

User’s position may be represented as a geolocation with longitude and latitude. The position may also be represented as a point in a scene. The scene may be represented as a bounding box on a geometry which represents the user’s real environment. When an AR/MR device reports the user position to obtain a split rendering of the immersive media from a server, the device calculating the user pose is expected to be either a geolocation, a point in a scene or a point in a user’s geometry. Depending on the representation, the server is assumed to be aware of the underlying scene or the geometry. A device is expected to update whenever there is any change in the scene or the geometry through user interaction (e.g., rotating a scene by hand gesture) and/or SLAM (e.g., finer modelling of surrounding environment)."

By use of the services provided by lower (sub-)layers, peer entities in a (sub-)layer in the MS and the network exchange information. Exchange of information between two peer entities is performed according to the corresponding (sub-)layer protocols. A protocol is a set of rules and formats by which the information (control information and user data) is exchanged between the two peers. The information is exchanged by use of messages which are defined in the protocol. (Therefore, the messages are also called Protocol Data Units, PDUs).","When two peer protocol entities exchange PDUs, a transaction is said to be established (or: to be active; or: to exist). It depends from the protocol when exactly a protocol entity considers the transaction to be active, normally this is the case:

from the moment when it has passed the first suitable message to lower (sub-) layers or received the first suitable message from its peer entity;

up to the moment when it has released the transaction.

Data Collection Coordination is supported by a DCCF or an NWDAF. The Data Consumer may use an NRF to perform NF discovery and selection to find a DCCF that can coordinate data collection (DCCF discovery principles are defined in clause 6.3.19 of TS 23.501 [2]). Data Consumers send requests for data to the DCCF rather than directly to the NF Data Source. Whether the data consumers directly contact the NF Data Source or goes via the DCCF is based on configuration of the data consumers. For the Data Consumer and each notification endpoint in a data request, the Data Consumer may specify Formatting and Processing Instructions that determine how the data is to be provided. Upon receiving a request from a Data Consumer, the selected DCCF determines the NF instance that can be a Data Source if the Data Source is not indicated in the Data Consumer's request. The DCCF may also select an ADRF if the data is to be stored in an ADRF and an ADRF endpoint is not indicated in the Data Consumer's request. To retrieve data for a specific UE, the NRF, UDM or BSF can provide the DCCF with the identity of the Data Source using the services indicated in table 5A.2-1.","

According to the definition of the Rel-17, DCCF is the data acquisition coordination node of the core network, the data acquisition area of DCCF is fixed, and the data source NF or data source NF set in the same area should be associated with only one DCCF instance or DCCF set. As described in TS 23.501 [2], multiple instances of DCCF may be deployed in a network. The NF consumers shall utilize the NRF to discover DCCF instance(s).

question 10054,How does the energy consumption of AR/MR applications compare to non-AR/MR applications?,AR/MR applications consume less energy,AR/MR applications consume the same amount of energy,AR/MR applications consume slightly more energy,AR/MR applications consume significantly more energy,None of the above,,,,"

The run time of a typical battery is proportional to its physical size, capacity, and weight, while they are proportional to user discomfort and neck torque. A study on the characteristics of AR applications [27] measured battery consumption of commercially available applications on AR, streaming, and social networking which shows that AR applications consume around at least 46% more energy than non-AR applications. The capacity of the battery needs to be designed to support a fair amount of running time for the everyday use of AR/MR applications. The amount of running time could be from tens of minutes for shopping of products via AR remote advertising in Annex A.2, 1-2 hours for streaming of volumetric video in Annex A.3, or even several hours for AR gaming in Annex A.6. However, as capacity is typically proportional to weight, and as the AR glasses is expected to be worn and equipped under the consideration of human ergonomics such as neck strain, there are clear limitations on extending the capacity of the battery. Such limitations may be relaxed by dynamically offloading some energy-intensive workloads to 5G cloud/edge. In this case, local processing power consumption is exchanged with power consumption for 3GPP/non-3GPP connectivity and an always on connectivity as well. For connectivity Discontinuous Reception (DRX) and Reduced Capability (RedCap) may be one of examples looking for lower power consumption for the radio for AR/MR application.","

From a media processing perspective, AR/MR applications consume far more energy than non-AR/MR applications [27]. Multiple, as well as different types of cameras are always turned on to track the features detected in 2D and 3D video every second. In the case when AR/MR objects are augmented into the real world, the objects need to be rendered frame by frame with different view frustum positions and directions.

question 10183,What are some physical security weaknesses in server architectures from a critical national infrastructure perspective?,Plug and play interfaces like USB,PCI Express bus Direct Memory Access (DMA),Hardware changes that are difficult to detect,All of the above,None of the above,,,,"

X86 and similar server architectures have a number of physical security weaknesses from a critical national infrastructure perspective. Plug and play interfaces (e.g. USB and removal RAID discs) unless disabled or tightly controlled represent a risk to 3GPP NF security. However, more difficult to control attack vectors such as PCI Express bus Direct Memory Access (DMA) or use of OS swap/page files represent risks if physical access to the server(s) hosting a 3GPP NF is possible. Similarly, whilst most server firmware would detect hardware changes (e.g. adding an extra copy physical network port which is visible to the host firmware), detection is more difficult where the replacement hardware uses the same IDs and declared interfaces.","In legacy 'Physical Network Function' (PNF) implementations, the physical security risks are better understood and are mitigated by physical constraints including secured racks, physical testing of interfaces to confirm they are disabled and careful placement of more sensitive functions (e.g. AUC) within CSP data centres. However, for virtualised implementations ,using large common hosts pools and physically securing all hosts (rather than those dedicated ones for a specific function) so that any 3GPP function can run on any host, controlling physical access attacks is difficult to achieve. This threat potentially increases with 'Infrastructure as a Service' (IAAS) and 'Network as a Service' (NAAS) deployments."

question 10196,What are the advantages of a consolidated multi-band design compared to separate designs?,Wider frequency range and lower gain,Better performance and optimization,Compactness and cost reduction,Higher gain and lower frequency range,Smaller circuit area and integration losses,,,,"

From the above discussions for different antenna array structures, either a multi-band antenna array (broadband or with multi-resonances) or separate antenna arrays with lower percentage bandwidth can be used in FR2 multiband RIB/BS. In comparison to separate antenna arrays, a consolidated multi-band design is more compact and reduces costs, but trades performance aspects that can be optimized for in separate designs. On the other hand, having separate designs enables dedicated optimizations, yielding better performance. However, this comes at the cost of a significantly larger circuit area being used for two designs and additional integration losses from lines and transitions.","

According to the definition in section 6.1, a multi-band FR2-1 RIB is a RIB that transmits in two or more FR2-1 bands using common active components. In this section, the feasibility of an FR2-1 multi-band solution is considered. The feasibility is examined taking into account technology challenges and emerging solutions. It is possible that not all parts of the BS are multi-band but that some advantage can be gained by implementing some parts as multi-band. For example one potential advantage of a multiband PA might be that power can be distributed between the supported bands offering more flexibility to optimize the power available for each, this requires only a multi-band PA."

This section introduces the functional framework for AI/ML for NR air interface illustrated in Figure 4.4-1. The aim of this framework is to cover a general functional architecture addressing both model-ID-based LCM and functionality-based LCM, introduced in clause 4.2. Therefore, some of the functions or data/information/instruction flows (i.e., the arrows) shown in the Figure 4.4-1 might not always be relevant for a given LCM approach. As an illustrative example, consider a scenario where the network performs functionality-based LCM and where models are not identified in the network, while the UE concurrently performs model-level management (e.g., model selection/switching/(de)activation, etc…). In this hypothetical case, the ""Model Training"" or ""Model Storage"" functions with their respective procedures, may be regarded as irrelevant from the network’s perspective.","This study explores the benefits of augmenting the air-interface with features enabling improved support of AI/ML.

A 5G AR/MR application provider offers an AR/MR experience to a 5G UE using an AR/MR application and 5G System and media functionalities. AR/MR content is typically agnostic to a delivery architecture and consists of one or more AR/MR objects, each of which usually corresponds to an immersive media type in clause 4.4.4 and may include their spatial and temporal compositions. The delivery of an immersive media adaptive to device capability and network bandwidth may be enabled by a delivery manifest in clause 4.4.5. Processing of AR/MR functions in 5GMS AS may require additional metadata in clause 4.4.3 to properly recognize user’s pose and surroundings.","AR/MR functions include encoding, decoding, rendering and compositing of AR/MR object, after which localization and correction is performed based on the user’s pose information.

STAR-based architecture has both basic AR functions and AR/MR functions on the device. EDGAR-based architecture has only basic AR functions on the device.

question 10230,What are the functions of multiple media decoders management and coordination in AR/MR?,To optimize the use of hardware decoding platform,To avoid resource competition and synchronization issues,To manage multiple decoder instances for different media components,All of the above,None of the above,,,,"

In order to integrate real-time media into AR scenes, a Media Access Function (MAF) provides the ability to access media and adds it to the AR scene. The MAF instantiates and manages Media Pipelines. A media pipeline typically handles content of an attribute/component of an object/mesh that is part of the scene graph. The media pipeline produces content in the format indicated by the scene description file. For real-time media, the formatted frame is then pushed into the circular buffer. Media Pipelines are typically highly optimized and customized for the type and format of media that is being fetched. Typically, for one scene, multiple media decoders of the same media type are needed to run in parallel. If the media decoders share the same hardware decoding platform on the UE, the MAF may also coordinate the different instances of media decoders to optimise the use of the hardware platform thus avoiding negative effects of resource competition or possible synchronization issues. MPEG-I Video Decoding Interface (ISO/IEC 23090-13 [6]) is an example specification that may fulfil this task of coordination. More information is available in clause 4.6.6. General considerations and challenges related to media decoder management is described in clause 4.4.6. Media Pipelines also maintain sync information (time and space) and passes that information as buffer metadata to the scene manager.","

The use of hardware video decoding platform is essential for the decoding of AR/MR content when it comes to power consumption, fast and scheduled decoding as well as battery usage. Modern hardware video decoding platform typically offer the capability to instantiate multiple decoders of the same media type at the same time and run multiple decoding instances in parallel. A typical example is the decoding of different components of the same AR/MR object, or the presentation of multiple objects in a scene. As a result, AR/MR application typically runs several decoder instances, in some cases using the same codec for different instances, in others different codecs for different streams. Note that this issue not only exists for video, but for any media type, in particular also for object-based audio. Under this high demand, there may be a resource competition and scheduled issues for the hardware decoding platform."

question 10323,What can dropping P and B frames in XRM services cause?,Improvement in network resource utilization,Priority transmission of I frames,Enhancement of high definition,Jitter in video quality,,,,,"Besides, in some XRM service, P frame and B frame are also important as I frame to construct the fluent video, dropping of those P frame and B frame causes jitter to the QoE which is not better than giving up the whole service. In some other XRM service, P frame and B frame are used to enhance the high definition, e.g. from 720p to 1080p. dropping of those P frame and B frame makes sense to keep the service when the network resource cannot transmit all of the service data.","

The XRM service PDUs have dependency with each other.

NOTE:	The details of rejection and cause codes is defined in TS 24.501 [47]."
question 10325,What can the AMF/MME do to ensure that the UE is not deregistered when it is out of coverage during eDRX?,Page the UE without expecting a reply,Buffer DL packets in the network,Use TAI or RAT specific configuration,Notify the AF about reachability status,,,,,"When the UE is out of coverage, the AMF/MME may page the UE based on the eDRX cycle but without getting a reply from the UE. TAI or RAT specific AMF/MME configuration is used to ensure that the UE is not deregistered in those cases and HLCOM can be used to buffer DL packets in the network or to notify the AF about reachability status.

Editor's note:	Additional enhancements to reduce failed paging attempts is FFS.

6.3.2	Procedures","

The solution does not guarantee that the UE cannot lose coverage while the UE is in CONNECTED state or while the Active Time timer is running. For example, if the UE loses coverage during the Active Time timer is running, the AMF/MME may page the UE without getting a reply. The UE may also not have coverage when the TAU timer expires e.g. in case the UE has moved to a new location during the out-of-coverage period. However, as in rel-17, the solution is stable to handle such cases. TAI or RAT specific MME configuration is used to ensure that the UE is not deregistered in those cases and HLCOM can be used to buffer DL packets in the network or to notify the AF about reachability status. Also, by using UE-provided Active Time and Periodic TAU Timer values based on coverage information, the risk for such failed paging or missed Periodic TAU Timers is reduced."

NAS RAI indicates that no further Uplink and Downlink Data transmissions are expected, or that only a single Downlink data transmission (e.g. Acknowledgement or response to Uplink data) subsequent to this Uplink Data transmission is expected.","In addition, the UE reports the Location Info-UE through the NAS message after the authentication and the SMC procedure or the initial NAS message in case of the UE is already registered. At this time, the uplink NAS message has been encrypted and integrity protected, and the initial NAS message has been protected by the initial NAS message protection mechanism. Therefore, the location information of the UE cannot be tampered by the false base station."
question 10328,What can the UE include in the Registration Request message to request eDRX parameters?,Periodic TAU Timer value,Extended idle mode DRX parameters information element,Active Time value,Coverage information,,,,,"If the UE supports eDRX and requests the use of eDRX, the UE shall include the Requested extended DRX parameters IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

The AMF/MME will then provide the eDRX parameters to the UE based on UE requested values, subscription data, etc."
question 10329,What can the UE request based on its awareness of coverage information in eDRX mode?,Active Time value,eDRX parameters,MICO mode,PSM mode,,,,,"

In this solution, the UE can request eDRX parameters based on its awareness of the coverage information. The eDRX cycle length is defined in TS 24.008 [8] and can only express certain fixed values. The available eDRX cycles may therefore not match the timing of the coverage and out-of-coverage for a UE. The UE may in this case request a eDRX cycle length that is less than the coverage window to ensure that the UE is reachable within the window. TAI or RAT specific AMF/MME configuration can be used to allow the AMF/MME to use the UE requested value when assigning the eDRX parameter in the reply to the UE.","For eDRX (Extended Discontinuous Reception), the UE requests eDRX parameters (e.g. cycle length) based on the estimate out of NTN coverage period and the estimate in NTN coverage period during the Registration Request procedure. The AMF takes the UE requested values into account and assigns the eDRX parameters in the Registration Accept message. If AMF is aware of NTN coverage analytics, the AMF considers both UE requested values and NTN coverage analytics to assign eDRX parameters.

question 10442,What does the CU-DU split in 5G architecture enable?,Increased scalability and deployment options,Enhanced mobility and handover,Better QoS and latency performance,Improved network slicing,,,,,"

Central Unit (CU) - Distributed Unit (DU): In 5G the base-station is logically split in CU and DU with an interface (the F1) between them. Security is provided for the CU-DU interface. This split was also possible in LTE, but in 5G it is part of the architecture that can support a number of deployment options (e.g. co-located CU-DU deployment is also possible). The DUs, which are deployed at the very edge of the network, don't have access to any user data when confidentiality protection is enabled. Even with the CU-DU split, the air interface security point in 5G remains the same as in LTE, namely in the radio access network.","

In the legacy network architecture, a gNB-CU-DU is only connected to one gNB-CU-CP. With the increasing number of connected gNB-CU-UP and gNB-DU, gNB-CU-CP will be in the risk of failure caused by the large amount of signalling processing. So this SI will introduce a mechanism to allow the gNB-CU-UP and gNB-DU to recovery service. Higher-layer split between gNB-CU and gNB-DU would enable highly-centralized gNB-CU deployment with large coverage area per gNB-CU, especially from C-Plane perspective. Likewise, Higher-layer split between gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP would enable highly-centralized gNB-CU-CP deployment with large coverage area per gNB-CU-CP."

question 10444,What does the Control Format Indicator (CFI) indicate in LTE?,The modulation and coding scheme,The number of OFDM symbols used for PDCCH,The time reference,The frequency allocation,The number of PDSCH transmissions,,,,"

Control Format Indicator (CFI) indicates how many OFDM symbols are used for the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH). In most cases, CFI is obtained by decoding the Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH). To ensure that PCFICH decoding does not degrade the overall downlink and uplink reliability, RRC configuration of CFI for any serving cell has been introduced in this work item. It is a separate CFI configuration for different Transmission Time Interval (TTI) lengths. If CFI is semi-statically configured for TTIs of different lengths, the UE does not expect the configured CFI values to be different. The semi-static CFI value can be configured separately for Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) and non-MBSFN subframes for each cell. When a UE is configured with a semi-static CFI for a given TTI length, the UE is not expected to decode PCFICH for that TTI length.","If a UE is configured with CrossCarrierSchedulingConfig for a serving cell, the carrier indicator field value corresponds to the value indicated by cif-InSchedulingCell in CrossCarrierSchedulingConfig. If a UE is configured with MC-DCI-SetofCells for a set of serving cells, the UE can be provided nCI-Value for the set of serving cells."

4.3	Virtualisation of 3GPP Network Functions","

The NFV Management Network Orchestration functions (MANO) are responsible for on-boarding, instantiation and life cycle management of all VNF within a virtualised network. Combined with 3GPP layer OSS/BSS functions they control all VNFs and indirectly (via the hypervisor or hosts) can access all data within those VNFs, unless specially protected. Compromising MANO would effectively compromise all VNFs (to a much less extent the same applies to the OSS/BSS).

In computing, virtualisation encompasses a number of different techniques to create a virtual, or software, version of a computing device. Examples of devices and systems which may be virtualised include hardware platforms, memory, storage or a network. The present document primarily addresses the security of Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) as defined by ETSI. However, the security threat, risks and mitigations are applicable to any other similar virtualisation approach. In the context of a 3GPP network, NFV refers to the deployment of Network Functions (NFs) as software modules which run on 'off the shelf' computing hardware. This contrasts with the traditional deployment of 3GPP network components as specialized hardware devices. Implementation of the 5G Service Based Architecture (SBA) relies on the use of NFV, among other technologies.","Clause 6.2 of ETSI GS NFV-EVE 011 [7] describes a set of characteristics which relate to cloud-native virtualized network functions (VNFs) including: redundancy – resiliency, fault monitoring and failure detection, scaling in/out, decomposition, automated instantiation and configuration, load balancing, and automated resource management."

question 10733,What is a spatial map in AR/MR?,Digital representation of the real world,Sparse or dense point cloud or mesh,Map generated from keyframes and visual features,All of the above,None of the above,,,,"

Finally, a spatial map may be generated from keyframes and their matched visual features. A spatial map is, thus, a digital representation of the real world surrounding users consisting of at least one spatial feature cloud, e.g., 3D points (vector of 3 floats) with their associated descriptors such as SIFT [59], SURF [60], or ORB [61]. The geometrical part of the spatial map may be represented as a sparse or dense point cloud or a mesh. The mapping process may be performed either at runtime or offline. The spatial map is then used at runtime to relocalize and thus register the AR device by matching the visual features extracted from the current captured frames with spatial features stored in the spatial map. The spatial mapping approach described herein is one of well-known keyframe-based SLAM techniques [58]. ","1)	Spatial anchors are used for establishing the position of a 3D object in a shared AR/MR experience, independent of the individual perspective of the users. Spatial anchors are accurate within a limited space (e.g. 3m radius for the Microsoft® Mixed Reality Toolkit). Multiple anchors may be used for larger spaces.

question 10735,What is an interworking key management record (InterKMRec) used for?,To enable secure InterSD messaging between a MC UE and a non-3GPP system,To authenticate signalling packets,To manage LMR security mechanisms,To encrypt interworking media,,,,,"

To support interworking key management with a non-3GPP system (i.e. InterSD messaging), an interworking MC UE may require provisioning of an interworking key management record (InterKMRec) that supports the secure transfer of InterSD messages. Generally speaking, an InterKMRec provides initial key management parameters needed to send, receive, address, protect, or otherwise interpret InterSD messages passed between an interworking 3GPP MC UE and the non-3GPP interworking system (e.g. interworking key management addressing, interworking key management identifiers, interworking key management root keys, or other interworking key management related parameters).","For example, when an interworking MC user performs key management authorization, the MC service ID of the user is used to identify the set of InterKMRecs associated to that MC service ID.  The KMS selects one of the associated InterKMRecs (assuming at least one record exists) and then further makes a dynamic association between the client ID making the request and the Secondary InterKMRec ID, this way uniquely identifying the interworking MC user and each interworking MC client the MC user is using."

AR/MR experiences involve augmenting visual/auditory contents into the real world to improve the user’s experience with better immersiveness, unlike VR, which provides an entirely virtual world. To realize these experiences, glass-type AR/MR devices may be a good candidate device, easily combining the lights from the real world and those from the display without a need of holding a device in one’s hand.","The sense of presence is not only important to VR experiences, but equally so to immersive AR experiences. To achieve Presence in Augmented Reality, seamless integration of virtual content and physical environment is required. Like in VR, the virtual content has to align with user's expectations. For truly immersive AR and in particular MR, it is expected that users cannot discern virtual objects from real objects."

The maximum separation is also a parameter which is difficult to agree as it depends on a number of things, a fixed antenna array may have a separation of up to 0.9λ (at its maximum operational frequency). In previous studies [xx] it has been assumed for BS antenna simulations that a fully steerable antenna array has a separation of 0.5-0.7λ to avoid grating lobes.","Using another approach and taking antenna element separation 0.5λ at a higher limit, the scanning angle reaches ±60º at 26 GHz and ±45º at 38 GHz with acceptable side lobe/grating lobe levels, as shown in Figure 5.3.2-2. The corresponding spacing will be 0.34λ at a lower limit. The isolation among the antenna elements at a lower limit can be ensured with the use of decoupling structures.

At runtime, the AR/MR application expects the decoded frames for each AR/MR object to be ready at the same point in time so that further processing of this AR/MR object may happen without loss of frames or delay introduced due to buffering. However, the concurrent decoder instances may exhibit different performance in terms of decoding delay for each frame.

In order to integrate real-time media into AR scenes, a Media Access Function (MAF) provides the ability to access media and adds it to the AR scene. The MAF instantiates and manages Media Pipelines. A media pipeline typically handles content of an attribute/component of an object/mesh that is part of the scene graph. The media pipeline produces content in the format indicated by the scene description file. For real-time media, the formatted frame is then pushed into the circular buffer. Media Pipelines are typically highly optimized and customized for the type and format of media that is being fetched. Typically, for one scene, multiple media decoders of the same media type are needed to run in parallel. If the media decoders share the same hardware decoding platform on the UE, the MAF may also coordinate the different instances of media decoders to optimise the use of the hardware platform thus avoiding negative effects of resource competition or possible synchronization issues. MPEG-I Video Decoding Interface (ISO/IEC 23090-13 [6]) is an example specification that may fulfil this task of coordination. More information is available in clause 4.6.6.

The maximum number of UEs is one of the attributes in the GST documented in GSMA 5GJA NG.116 [6] characterising the network slice (one S-NSSAI) and defined as the maximum number of UEs that can use the network slice simultaneously. The max. number of UEs that can use the network slice simultaneously is one criteria for usage control of network slice, it is therefore an aspect to be considered for converged charging. Since the maximum number of simultaneous UEs can part of the offering and in the extension part of the price for the offering, then also the number of UEs that use the network slice simultaneously can be a criterion for the charging (i.e. rate and cost). For example, if during a period it never goes above a specific number of simultaneous UEs one price and if it does go above another price.","In GSMA 5GJA NG.116 [6], there are two attributes the maximum number of UEs and the maximum number of PDU sessions, which characterising the network slice (one S-NSSAI) and defined as the maximum number of UEs and the maximum number of PDU sessions that can use the network slice simultaneously.

question 11315,What is the recommended method to carry meta-data for HTTP/2 media payload?,Using a new TCP option,Using RTP extended headers,Using a new UDP option,Using QUIC extension headers,Using SRTP experimental headers,,,,"

HTTP/2 relies on TCP transport and its congestion control mechanisms result in variable delays. Meanwhile, HTTP/3 uses a QUIC/UDP transport layer which is not in kernel and can have more flexibility with congestion control, but is otherwise like HTTP/2 for the purposes of this discussion. Since the QUIC transport is UDP based, this solution proposes to carry the new meta-data on the media payload in a new UDP option [45]. Another option is to use meta-data extension headers in QUIC to carry media packet information that can be used for packet QoS classification (based on IETF Media over QUIC (MOQ) [63]).","HTTP/2 on the other hand is relatively well suited for XR applications due to supports for dynamically multiplexed and prioritized streams (e.g. 6DoF media streams) in a single TCP connection. HTTP/2 also has and lower latency since there is no HTTP head of line blocking. However, the HTTP/2 connection payload carries dynamically multiplexed streams and may be encrypted, thus it is not practical to inspect at line-speed. The proposal here is to carry new meta-data in a new TCP option [44] in the packet along with the HTTP/2 media payload. The meta-data carried characterizes the HTTP/2 media payload in the packet."

NOTE:	Whether the PDU Set Metadata of a PDU Set is stripped by the RAN before attempting transmission of the related PDUs over the radio interface or is sent to and used by the UE depends on RAN WG discussions.

6.20.4	Impacts on services, entities and interfaces

AS:

(Optional) Provides metadata over N6 identify different PDU Sets.

UPF:

(Optional) receives metadata over N6 to identify different PDU Sets.","The solution is based on the UPF generating additional N3 PDU Set metadata to be provided in the PDU (i.e. GTP-U) headers to the RAN to help it identify PDU Sets and to which PDU Set a PDU belongs, so that the RAN can properly determine how to use the allocated resources. How the UPF generates the N3 PDU Set Metadata is independent of how the N3 PDU Set Metadata is encoded and sent to the RAN. Figure 6.20.2.2-1 shows the N3 PDU Set metadata added to the PDUs by the UPF and sent to the RAN."

Without extra security controls an attacker who gains access to one of these accounts would be able to exploit, control and manage the entire NFV environment.

The global administrator role is considered to exist in the highest trust domain for the 3GPP architecture.","

As discussed in clause 4.4.3, NFV deployments usually rely on a single administration domain, with a global administrator who is able to manage the hosts and NFV environment. As such, at some level, all VNFs regardless of their sensitivity are potentially reduced to the same security level of the single administration domain. Therefore, if an attacker is able to gain global administrator privileges, they will be able to control and manage all Network Functions, regardless of their sensitivity and trust domain."

The spatial map is then used at runtime to relocalize and thus register the AR device by matching the visual features extracted from the current captured frames with spatial features stored in the spatial map. The spatial mapping approach described herein is one of well-known keyframe-based SLAM techniques [58]. "

The user experience resulting from the use of 5G network slicing is critical for commercial success, and therefore testing the operation of 5G network slicing is necessary to ensure consistent predictable behaviour. To enable testing the 5G UEs supporting network slicing as they are used in the field the application layer at the device side needs to be included in the testing, as URSP based network slice selection and traffic routing procedures are based on traffic descriptor components (see TS 24.526) passed on by the application layer to the UE protocol stack. The traffic descriptor components that are passed onto the UE protocol stack to be used as a base for the network slice selection when a specific application requests a PDU session are configured within the device. There is a strong industry demand to define the test methods and test procedures that include the full related UE application layer in the testing of the network slice selection functionality for 5G UE supporting network slicing.

question 11561,When can Network assisted Sidelink Positioning be used?,When a UE is in coverage,When a UE is out of coverage,When a UE is registered to the network,When a UE is in a known area,When a UE is unreachable,,,,"

This key issue addresses the case when a UE is not able to perform Uu based positioning estimation. The UE may be out of network coverage, or have network coverage but not able to measure on enough gNBs to perform Uu based positioning. In this case, the UE (i.e. partial coverage or in network coverage) may use Sidelink Positioning to obtain relative positioning with a Located UE which is in network coverage. This case is referred to as Sidelink Positioning in TR 38.845 [6]. In this KI we call this case Network assisted Sidelink Positioning.","Since Network assisted Sidelink Positioning requires Ranging/Sidelink positioning between the UE and a Located UE, a Located UE needs to be determined. Located UE has to be in proximity of the UE out of coverage; however, UE should not be assumed to proactively discover a Located UE, because it doesn't know when a location service request comes.

question 11585,When does the UE wake up according to the eDRX parameters?,When the UE receives a paging occasion,When there is coverage in the network,When the UE initiates a MO signalling request,When the UE is about to leave the network coverage,When there is no network coverage,,,,"

The available eDRX cycles may not match the timing of the coverage for a UE. Then this occurs the network can provide the UE with an eDRX cycle that is a divisor of the coverage time. For example, if there is coverage in 60 mins time, and the available eDRX cycles would be 20mins, 40min, 80min, then the 20min cycle should be selected (example is for illustration and is not using actual eDRX cycle time values). When combined with the UEs knowledge of when there is no network coverage the UE will avoid waking up. The network knows the UE coverage and therefore can avoid paging the UE. When there is available network coverage, the UE can wake up according to the eDRX parameters and the network can page the UE as usual.","The solution allows the UE to take into account the coverage information from RAN when determining when to wake-up as well as the assigned eDRX cycle, which may not match the expected coverage from RAN. The UE is reachable during the DRX PTWs that coincide with the expected coverage for the UE, if eDRX is used. If eDRX is not used the UE is unreachable until it connects to the network (e.g. for MO traffic or TAU/periodic registration).

question 11586,When does the location execution phase occur in the scheduled location time process?,After the location preparation phase,At or near the scheduled location time,At the beginning of the location preparation phase,,,,,,"

A scheduled location time allows an external LCS Client, AF or the UE to specify a time in the future at which a current location of the UE is to be obtained. A scheduled location time can be used with a 5GC-MT-LR, 5GC-MO-LR or deferred 5GC-MT-LR for periodic or triggered location events. The location preparation phase starts when a location related request is sent by an LCS Client, AF or UE requesting a current location of the UE. The request includes the scheduled location time T. As part of the location preparation phase, the 5GC, and UE interact to determine suitable position methods and schedule location measurements of the UE. The LMF coordinates the interaction and is aware of the scheduled location time. The location preparation phase ends at or near to the time T and is followed by a location execution phase in which the UE location is obtained and returned to the external LCS Client, AF or the UE.","Scheduled location time: During positioning procedure, the LMF may obtain the scheduled location time from the AMF. Based on the obtained scheduled location time, the LMF may schedule location measurements by the UE and/or location measurement by the NG-RAN to occur at or near to the scheduled location time.

question 11618,Where does the RAN derive CDRX configurations from?,UDM's SMF associated data,UE's power status,XR Communication Pattern information,3rd party application server,,,,,"

The current CDRX specification already allows UE to send its preference for CDRX parameters to RAN and allows the RAN to determine reasonable CDRX parameters and configure the UE with them. Now Key Issue #8 is studying CDRX assistance information that 5GC derives based on XR media characteristic and sends to RAN. This means RAN will end up considering information from 5GC as well as from UE when determining CDRX parameters. A probable scenario is RAN prioritizes information from UE. In this case, XR AF keeps sending media stream with the same codec and data rate that do not fit to the determined CDRX parameters, then CDRX gets less effective due to always using InactivityTimer and QoE is also at risk of becoming lower. An approach to solve this issue is to let XR AF know the determined CDRX parameters, so that the XR AF can take any necessary actions in terms of adjusting e.g. codecs and data rates.","2.	Based on this information, the RAN node configures the UE with an adaptable CDRX configuration. An adaptable CDRX configuration is a configuration that allows the UE to autonomously change a parameter of the configuration (i.e. the UE may select what value (e.g. inactivity timer) are applied in the configuration).

NOTE 1:	This part of the solution requires coordination with RAN WGs.

question 11660,Which LTE feature allows sending the same PDCP Protocol Data Unit (PDU) on two independent transmission paths?,UL SPS repetition,Granular time reference provision,PDCP packet duplication,PDSCH repetition,Semi-static CFI configuration,,,,"

In case of Carrier Aggregation (CA) or in case of Dual Connectivity (DC), PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) packet duplication can be applied to improve the overall reliability for downlink and possibly for uplink depending on UE power limitation. PDCP packet duplication is configured for a radio bearer by RRC where two logical channels are configured for the radio bearer. The two logical channels can either belong to the same MAC entity (CA case) or different MAC entities (DC case). When activated, PDCP packet duplication allows sending the same PDCP Protocol Data Unit (PDU) on two independent transmission paths: via the primary RLC entity and a secondary RLC entity, thereby increasing reliability.","

Release-13 LWA supports uplink transmission on LTE only. Uplink support added in Release-14 is conceptually similar to Dual Connectivity (DC) uplink support, with some adjustments made for WLAN: the eNB may configure an uplink data split threshold and if the data available for transmission in the UE is above that threshold, the UE submits PDCP PDUs to either AM RLC entity or WLAN.

question 11870,Which method of transferring coverage data would minimize the impact on the MME/AMF?,User plane transfer,O&M transfer,NGAP/S1AP transfer,NAS transfer,SBI transfer,,,,"

Since it has been shown that ephemeris data can be very inefficient when it comes to calculation of coverage periods and could be less accurate and with other drawbacks as described in clause 7.4.1, the SIB solution for ephemeris data transfer could be ruled out. That leaves NAS transfer to a UE (included in 4 solutions) or user plane transfer from an external server or DCAF according to Solution #15. NAS transfer will impact an AMF and MME in terms of extra NAS signalling and support for obtaining (e.g. via O&M or from an external server) and transferring the coverage map data, but in case both AMF/MME and UE are requiring satellite coverage data, it will insure that same information is shared and synchronized on both sides. It will also be interesting if no SMS nor IP are available User plane transfer can avoid MME/AMF impacts in the case of the DCAF solution or reduce the impacts in the case of user plane transfer from an external server, where the impact is to provide a URI for the external server plus information to be included by the UE in a request to the external server.","The AMF determines whether the addition authentication for coverage map transfer to the UE with CMT ID, and triggers the coverage map transfer procedure.
