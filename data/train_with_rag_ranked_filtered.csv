Load-Balancing without pre-defined split percentages: This introduces enhancements to the Load-Balancing steering mode, which is a steering mode that splits the traffic of a data flow (in uplink and downlink direction separately) across the 3GPP and the non-3GPP accesses. In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages (referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP access, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17, however, the network may provide an ""autonomous load-balance indicator"" in which case the UE and the UPF can freely and independently select their own percentages for each access type. The selected percentages may change over time, e.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select the percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput. This means that using a load-balancing steering mode with the ""autonomous load-balance indicator"" can maximize the throughput of a given data flow in the uplink and in the downlink direction."

For the Session Breakout scenario, only the 3GPP access should be allowed for the EC traffic, because the UL-CL is reachable only through that access, since there are no ATSSS procedures that would ensure that an UL-CL can be on path when the UE connects through a non-3GPP access. Based on the received EC related policy and deployment information the SMF may, however, select an UL-CL based on existing procedures if the UE connects through a 3GPP access. One simple solution to keep the EC traffic to 3GPP access is to set the Access Type Preference to ""3GPP"" in the corresponding URSP rule for this PDU Session. To avoid other, non-EC traffic be constrained to the 3GPP access, WIFI offload can be setup for that traffic using the ""Non-Seamless Offload indication"" as route selection in the corresponding URSP rule. An example URSP rule set is given in table 6.41.2-1.

question 1166,Which feature in Rel-16 allows transmission of uplink data payload without performing random access procedures? [3GPP Release 16],UE-group wake-up signals (GWUS),Mobile-terminated early data transmission (MT-EDT),Support for Preconfigured uplink resources (PUR) in idle mode,Scheduling of multiple DL/UL transport blocks with single DCI,Presence of NRS on a non-anchor carrier for paging,option 3: Support for Preconfigured uplink resources (PUR) in idle mode,The feature Support for Preconfigured uplink resources (PUR) in idle mode allows uplink transmission without performing random access procedures.,Standards overview,1166,3,"

In Rel-16, the earlier transmission of UL data payload has been further enhanced by introducing UL transmission using preconfigured uplink resources (PUR). This feature allows eNB to configure uplink resources, in which a UE in IDLE mode can send UL transmission without performing random access procedures. The UE can be potentially configured with a cyclic shift of DMRS, which allows sharing of the preconfigured resources under which up to two users can transmit NPUSCH simultaneously when the NPUSCH transmission is larger than or equal to 64ms for 12-tone allocation. By skipping the random access procedures, the uplink transmission efficiency can be improved and UE power consumption is reduced. Before performing a PUR transmission, the UE must evaluate the validity of the timing advance (TA) based on either individual or combined usage of any of the following attributes: a) serving cell change, b) TA timer, c) RSRP change. Additionally, it is possible to configure the TA as always valid within a given cell."

7.	Prioritization between overlapping uplink resources of one UE: when multiple UL grants provided to a single UE overlap in time on a serving cell, the UE is now able to consider the priority of the grant and/or the priority of the logical channel that can be carried over the grant when making a decision about which grant to utilize. Similarly, the UE may consider the priority of a scheduling request (SR) as well as priority of the logical channel which triggered the SR when deciding whether to transmit PUSCH or SR when they overlap in time. Furthermore, if two PUCCHs of different PHY priorities or a PUCCH and a PUSCH of different PHY priorities are overlapping in time on a serving cell, the UE is able to cancel the lower priority transmission with the specified cancellation behaviour and related timeline to allow for transmission of the PUSCH or PUCCH of higher PHY priority.

Load-Balancing without pre-defined split percentages: This introduces enhancements to the Load-Balancing steering mode, which is a steering mode that splits the traffic of a data flow (in uplink and downlink direction separately) across the 3GPP and the non-3GPP accesses. In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages (referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP access, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17, however, the network may provide an ""autonomous load-balance indicator"" in which case the UE and the UPF can freely and independently select their own percentages for each access type. The selected percentages may change over time, e.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select the percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput. This means that using a load-balancing steering mode with the ""autonomous load-balance indicator"" can maximize the throughput of a given data flow in the uplink and in the downlink direction."

question 3918,What is the redundancy version number used for the initial transmission or autonomous retransmission of an initial transport block for a PUSCH transmission? [3GPP Release 17],0,1,2,3,repK-RV,option 1: 0,The redundancy version number used for the initial transmission or autonomous retransmission of an initial transport block for a PUSCH transmission is 0.,Standards specifications,3918,1,"

A single Transport Block (TB) using a resource allocated over multiple slots is introduced for PUSCH except Msg3. A UE scheduled to perform a TBoMS transmission, via either dynamic or configured grant (Type 2), uses the resource allocated across multiple slots to calculate the transport block size (TBS) for the transmission. Advantages of this approach as compared to single-slot PUSCH operations are in the form of lower effective coding rate and/or energy per resource element (EPRE) increase, both advantages leading to coverage enhancement. A TBoMS transmission can be performed w/ or w/o repetition, where a TBoMS transmission w/o repetition is referred to as single TBoMS transmission. The number of slots allocated for TBoMS is counted based on available slots. The UE transmits the TB across the slots determined as available for the TBoMS transmission, applying the same symbol and PRBs allocation in each slot, regardless of whether TBoMS is scheduled w/ or w/o repetition. Collision handling rules of Type A PUSCH repetition apply for TBoMS. TBS of a single TBoMS transmission is calculated using the resource in all the slots allocated for the single TBoMS transmission. The maximum supported TBS for TBoMS does not exceed legacy maximum supported TBS in Rel-15/16, for the same number of layers. TBoMS supports the transmission of only one layer and one code block. A single redundancy version (RV) is used for the transmission of a single TBoMS, irrespective of the number of slots allocated for a single TBoMS transmission, as per Figure 1. RV cycling is used across repetitions of a single TBoMS, as per Figure 2 . Rate Matching (RM) for TBoMS is performed per slot."

NR sidelink supports sidelink HARQ-ACK for sidelink unicast and groupcast services for improved reliability. Two sidelink HARQ feedback operations are defined, HARQ-ACK with ACK and NACK, and HARQ-ACK with NACK only. When ACK/NACK operation is used, the sidelink HARQ-ACK procedure is similar to that of Uu for non-codeblock group feedback, i.e. the HARQ-ACKis transmitted based on the success or failure of the whole transport block. NACK-only operation is defined for groupcast to allow a a larger number of Rx UEs to share a single PSFCH resource by sending feedback only when a Rx UE receives SCI but fails to decode the transport block. The transmission of NACK-only feedback can be restricted to UEs within given a radius, and any UE beyond it does not provide any HARQ-ACK. This minimum range requirement of a service is provided together with the associated QoS parameters from service layers. For mode 1, sidelink HARQ-ACK information is reported to gNB to indicate whether additional retransmission resources are required or not."

The MCCH information (i.e. information transmitted in messages sent over MCCH) is transmitted periodically, using a configurable repetition period and within a configured transmission window. MCCH transmissions (and the associated radio resources and MCS) are indicated via the PDCCH addressed to MCCH-RNTI. PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) for MCCH transmission are determined according to the common search space indicated by searchspaceMCCH. If searchspaceMCCH is set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for MCCH message reception in the MCCH transmission window are the same as PDCCH monitoring occasions for SIB1 where the mapping between PDCCH monitoring occasions and SSBs is specified in TS 38.213[13]. If searchspaceMCCH is not set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for MCCH message are determined based on search space indicated by searchspaceMCCH. PDCCH monitoring occasions for MCCH message which are not overlapping with UL symbols (determined according to tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon) are sequentially numbered from one in the MCCH transmission window. The [x×N+K]th PDCCH monitoring occasion for MCCH message in MCCH transmission window corresponds to the Kth transmitted SSB, where x = 0, 1, ...X-1, K = 1, 2, …N, N is the number of actual transmitted SSBs determined according to ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 and X is equal to CEIL(number of PDCCH monitoring occasions in MCCH transmission window/N). The actual transmitted SSBs are sequentially numbered from one in ascending order of their SSB indexes. The UE assumes that, in the MCCH transmission window, PDCCH for an MCCH message is transmitted in at least one PDCCH monitoring occasion corresponding to each transmitted SSB and thus the selection of SSB for the reception MCCH messages is up to UE implementation."

The atmospheric ducting phenomenon, caused by lower densities at higher altitudes in the Earth's atmosphere, causes a reduced refractive index, causing the signals to bend back towards the Earth. A signal trapped in the atmospheric duct can reach distances far greater than normal. In TDD networks with the same UL/DL slot configuration, and in the absence of atmospheric ducting, a guard period is used to avoid the interference between UL and DL transmissions in different cells. However, when the atmospheric ducting phenomenon happens, radio signals can travel a relatively long distance, and the propagation delay exceeds the guard period. Consequently, the DL signals of an aggressor cell can interfere with the UL signals of a victim cell that is far away from the aggressor. Such interference is termed as remote interference. The further the aggressor is to the victim, the more UL symbols of the victim will be impacted."

Load-Balancing without pre-defined split percentages: This introduces enhancements to the Load-Balancing steering mode, which is a steering mode that splits the traffic of a data flow (in uplink and downlink direction separately) across the 3GPP and the non-3GPP accesses. In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages (referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP access, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17, however, the network may provide an ""autonomous load-balance indicator"" in which case the UE and the UPF can freely and independently select their own percentages for each access type. The selected percentages may change over time, e.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select the percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput.
