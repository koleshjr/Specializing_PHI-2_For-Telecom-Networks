5	Recommendations

In this study, we have identified the need to define a network based solution which aims at verifying the reported UE location information.

The verification should be performed independently from the location information reported by UE.

The UE location information for the study is considered verified if the reported UE location is consistent with the network based assessment to within 5-10 km (similar to terrestrial network macro cell size), enabling country discrimination and selection of an appropriate core network in order to support all the regulatory services (i.e. emergency call, lawful intercept, public warning, charging/billing)."

This helps to extend UE battery life.,Standards overview,152,1,"A NB-IoT UE has to wait up to 10 seconds, after the receipt of the RRCConnectionRelease message, in case lower layers do not indicate successful acknowledgement of the reception. This feature allows that, in case the UE is not polled, the UE can consider the receipt of the RRCConnectionRelease message to be successfully acknowledged as soon as the UE has sent HARQ ACK. This feature was introduced from the Rel-14 specifications.

Relaxed monitoring for cell reselection (FDD and TDD)



This feature allows much of the RRM monitoring to be avoided in cases where an NB-IoT UE is stationary and/or the network topology is not changing, and UE battery life can be correspondingly extended. The network configures the UE with a 'NRSRP delta' threshold, and while the change in RSRP its current cell is less than the threshold, the UE does not need to monitor neighbouring cells for 24 hours. This feature was introduced from the Rel-14 specifications.

In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages (referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP access, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17, however, the network may provide an ""autonomous load-balance indicator"" in which case the UE and the UPF can freely and independently select their own percentages for each access type. The selected percentages may change over time, e.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select the percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput.

The present document is applicable primarily to mission critical services using E-UTRAN access based on the EPC architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [17]. Certain MC service functions such as dispatch and administrative functions could also be supported via non-3GPP access networks but no additional functionality is specified to support non-3GPP access.

The common functional architecture to support mission critical services can be used for public safety applications and also for general commercial applications e.g. utility companies and railways.

question 1029,What should URSP rules based on AF guidance not be set as? [3GPP Release 18],Match all traffic descriptor,URSP rules with low priority,URSP rules without traffic descriptor,URSP rules for specific locations,,option 1: Match all traffic descriptor,URSP rules based on AF guidance should not be set with a 'match all' traffic descriptor.,Standards specifications,1029,1,"

For the Session Breakout scenario, only the 3GPP access should be allowed for the EC traffic, because the UL-CL is reachable only through that access, since there are no ATSSS procedures that would ensure that an UL-CL can be on path when the UE connects through a non-3GPP access. Based on the received EC related policy and deployment information the SMF may, however, select an UL-CL based on existing procedures if the UE connects through a 3GPP access. One simple solution to keep the EC traffic to 3GPP access is to set the Access Type Preference to ""3GPP"" in the corresponding URSP rule for this PDU Session. To avoid other, non-EC traffic be constrained to the 3GPP access, WIFI offload can be setup for that traffic using the ""Non-Seamless Offload indication"" as route selection in the corresponding URSP rule. An example URSP rule set is given in table 6.41.2-1. Note that the traffic descriptors in the URSP rules may need to be updated, e.g. based on AF Application guidance for URSP determination, resulting that the updated URSP rules might not be immediately enforced for some ongoing traffic."

question 1166,Which feature in Rel-16 allows transmission of uplink data payload without performing random access procedures? [3GPP Release 16],UE-group wake-up signals (GWUS),Mobile-terminated early data transmission (MT-EDT),Support for Preconfigured uplink resources (PUR) in idle mode,Scheduling of multiple DL/UL transport blocks with single DCI,Presence of NRS on a non-anchor carrier for paging,option 3: Support for Preconfigured uplink resources (PUR) in idle mode,The feature Support for Preconfigured uplink resources (PUR) in idle mode allows uplink transmission without performing random access procedures.,Standards overview,1166,3,"

In Rel-16, the earlier transmission of UL data payload has been further enhanced by introducing UL transmission using preconfigured uplink resources (PUR). This feature allows eNB to configure uplink resources, in which a UE in IDLE mode can send UL transmission without performing random access procedures. The UE can be potentially configured with a cyclic shift of DMRS, which allows sharing of the preconfigured resources under which up to two users can transmit NPUSCH simultaneously when the NPUSCH transmission is larger than or equal to 64ms for 12-tone allocation. By skipping the random access procedures, the uplink transmission efficiency can be improved and UE power consumption is reduced. Before performing a PUR transmission, the UE must evaluate the validity of the timing advance (TA) based on either individual or combined usage of any of the following attributes: a) serving cell change, b) TA timer, c) RSRP change. Additionally, it is possible to configure the TA as always valid within a given cell."

As for the system-wide features, presented in sections 5 to 18, the overall trend in Rel-16 is to make the 3GPP 5G System (5GS) a communication-enabling platform suitable for a wide range of industries (“verticals”), such as e.g. transportation (autonomous driving V2X, Railways, Maritime), automated factories, healthcare, public safety and many more. In this respect, the versatility and reliability of the 5GS has been further increased to make it industry-grade compatible, with enhancements to Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), Network Slicing, Edge Computing, Cellular IoT (Internet of Things), Non-Public Networks, Positioning Services and LAN-type services. In addition, the use of 5G as an underlying communication network (i.e. to be used transparently by applications external to the network) has been enhanced, mostly under the work on ""Northbound APIs"".

Prioritization between overlapping uplink resources of one UE: when multiple UL grants provided to a single UE overlap in time on a serving cell, the UE is now able to consider the priority of the grant and/or the priority of the logical channel that can be carried over the grant when making a decision about which grant to utilize. Similarly, the UE may consider the priority of a scheduling request (SR) as well as priority of the logical channel which triggered the SR when deciding whether to transmit PUSCH or SR when they overlap in time. Furthermore, if two PUCCHs of different PHY priorities or a PUCCH and a PUSCH of different PHY priorities are overlapping in time on a serving cell, the UE is able to cancel the lower priority transmission with the specified cancellation behaviour and related timeline to allow for transmission of the PUSCH or PUCCH of higher PHY priority."

In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages (referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP access, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17, however, the network may provide an ""autonomous load-balance indicator"" in which case the UE and the UPF can freely and independently select their own percentages for each access type. The selected percentages may change over time, e.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select the percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput.

1	Scope

This document specifies the functional architecture, procedures and information flows needed to support the Mission Critical Data (MCData) services. MCData is a suite of services which utilizes the common functional architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] to support MC services over LTE including the common services core. 

MCData services suite consists of the following sub-services:

short data service (SDS);

file distribution (FD);

data streaming (DS); and

NOTE:	Procedures for DS are not covered in the current specification.

IP connectivity.

MCData features include:

conversation management;

transmission and reception control;

communication release; and

enhanced status.

The corresponding service requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 22.282 [3] and 3GPP TS 22.280 [2]."
question 1217,What is the purpose of service continuity in the Evolved Packet System? [3GPP Release 17],To optimize routing for user plane traffic,To support mobility within and across access systems,To minimize packet loss during inter- and/or intra-access technology changes,To provide continuous service during and following changes of access systems,To support simultaneous usage of multiple accesses,option 4: To provide continuous service during and following changes of access systems,Service continuity ensures that service is maintained during and following changes of access systems.,Standards specifications,1217,4,"

3GPP TS 23.548 [8] and 3GPP TS 23.558 [10] specifies that, service continuity is required for EAS relocation and service continuity relies on application layer support of seamless context/status relocation between the EAS servers. Transport layer connection re-establishment also causes service interrupts. Thus EAS IP replacement is also discussed in 3GPP TS 23.548 [8], assuming that real-time transport layer relocation is supported between the source EAS and target EAS. However, the real-time context/status relocation and transport layer real-time relocation are not always supported for the verticals/enterprises. In those cases where network support is not available, the application enablement layer can support this functionality for the application. The data delivery enabler service in network can maintain the transport layer connection with corresponding client in the UE. EAS can use such data delivery enabler service for EAS relocation (including context transfer and lossless packet transfer). Such data delivery enabler can ensure the UE's service continuity including seamless data delivery and enhanced transport layer management."

The enabled analytics information exposure to UE can be also disabled when the PDU Session is released.

The SMF may subscribe or request to analytics information provided by the NWDAF when receiving the enabling request for analytics information exposure sent by the UE.

When the SMF receives the enabling request for analytics information exposure from a UE, the SMF checks whether it has already subscribed to the Analytics ID related to the analytics information exposure with same input parameters to the NWDAF. If so, the SMF does not have to subscribe to the Analytics ID again. Otherwise, the SMF subscribes to the Analytics ID for the UE."

question 1358,Where can the UE receive PLMN identity and CN type information in a given cell? [3GPP Release 17],Data channel,Access channel,Control channel,Broadcast channel,Paging channel,option 4: Broadcast channel,The UE can receive PLMN identity and CN type information in a given cell through the broadcast channel.,Standards specifications,1358,4,"

The Cell Identity in NTN corresponds to a fixed geographical area identified by a Mapped Cell ID, irrespective of the orbit of the NTN payload or of the type of the service link. For a BL UE or a UE in enhanced coverage, the Cell Identity included within the target identification of the handover messages allows identifying the correct target cell. The mapping between Mapped Cell IDs and geographical areas is configured in the RAN and the Core Network (e.g. pre-configured depending on operator's policy, or based on implementation). For a BL UE or a UE in enhanced coverage or a NB-IoT UE that supports S1-U data transfer or User Plane CIoT EPS optimisation, the eNB is responsible for constructing the Mapped Cell ID based on the UE location information received from the UE, if available. The User Location Information may enable the MME to determine whether the UE is allowed to operate at its present location. Pre-configuration of special mapped cell identifiers may be used to indicate areas outside the serving PLMN's country."

7.6.1	AR/VR

Audio-visual interaction is characterised by a human being interacting with the environment or people, or controlling a UE, and relying on audio-visual feedback. In the use cases like VR and interactive conversation the latency requirements include the latencies at the application layer (e.g. codecs), which could be specified outside of 3GPP.

To support VR environments with low motion-to-photon capabilities, the 5G system shall support:

motion-to-photon latency in the range of 7 ms to 15ms while maintaining the required resolution of up to 8k giving user data rate of up to [1Gbit/s] and

motion-to-sound delay of [< 20 ms].

NOTE: 	The motion-to-photon latency is defined as the latency between the physical movement of a user's head and the updated picture in the VR headset. The motion-to-sound latency is the latency between the physical movement of a user's head and updated sound waves from a head mounted speaker reaching their ears."

To enable communication between exposed MnS consumers and exposed MnS producers, exposed MnS consumers need a mechanism to discover exposed MnS producers that are available in the 3GPP management system, this is called exposed MnS discovery service.



When the operator decides to expose a management service (exposed MnS), the operator needs to decide which MnS(s) should be exposed, which internal MnS operations should be abstracted/filtered, and which internal MnS data should be abstracted/filtered. As part of this decision, the operator may use the MnS Discovery Service to collect information. The operator exposes the MnS and registers it with the exposed MnS discovery service, this may be done using an EGMF.

The exposed MnS discovery service consumer sends a request to appropriate discovery service (e.g. exposed MnS discovery service producer) to obtain the exposed MnS data.

Reduced UE power consumption is achieved through reduced downlink monitoring and reduced signalling, building on features introduced in earlier releases.

UE-group wake-up signals (GWUS): Reduced UE power consumption in idle mode was enabled in Rel-15 by the introduction of the wake-up signal (WUS), a compact signal transmitted a configurable time before the paging occasion (PO) when a UE is being paged, allowing the UE to maximize its sleep time during periods when there is no paging. In Rel-16, an enhancement is introduced that allows a WUS to wake up a configurable group of UEs rather than all UEs that happen to monitor the same PO. This helps reduce the power consumption even further. The mapping of GWUS in the time and frequency domains is highly configurable."

question 1877,What is the SNR difference corresponding to a ∆thermal value of 6 dB? [3GPP Release 18],0.33 dB,0.9 dB,3.5 dB,1 dB,,option 4: 1 dB,A ∆thermal value of 6 dB corresponds to an SNR difference of 1 dB.,Standards specifications,1877,4,"These results show the relative degradation in SNR that can occur due to adjacent channel interferers leaking through the next larger BW filter, and the actual performance degradation will depend on a particular scenario, especially ACI strength and the UE channel filter overlap with the interfering signal. Typical 3GPP ACS requirements are conducted so that a UE should be able to meet 95% of the target throughput of the reference QPSK level when the adjacent interferer is 32dB higher than the wanted signal (and which corresponds to approximately -1.5dB SNR). Referring to the right-most point on the X-axis of Figure 6.1.3-3, it can be seen that 9MHz and 8MHz irregular channel SNR is above -1.5dB, while the 6MHz channel SNR is clearly below -1.5dB.

NOTE: 	The corresponding throughput measurements should be also provided to assess throughput degradation, if any, in the QPSK reference channel.

The impacts of such effects are described qualitatively below and assessed quantitatively in subsequent sections.

When considering the RSIC for self-interference and inter-sector interference, the following aspects and self-interference mitigation techniques have been considered:

Antenna isolation

For self-interference suppression, isolation between the transmitter and receiver antennas can be used to reduce both the transmitter leakage power transferred to the uplink sub-band and the power level of the TX sub-band signals that must be handled by the receiver. The antenna isolation may be impacted by the beamforming applied at both the transmitter and receiver."

10.9.1	General

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver unit ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations in the presence of an interfering signal received at a larger power spectral density. In this condition a throughput requirement shall be met for a specified reference measurement channel. 

The requirement applies at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same direction and are within the minSENS RoAoA.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization, under the assumption of polarization match. 

10.9.2	Minimum requirement for MSR operation

For E-UTRA, the minimum requirement for in-channel selectivity is specified in subclause 10.9.4.

For NR, the minimum requirement for in channel selecitivity is the same as that specified for BS type 1-O in 3GPP TS 38.104 [28] in subclause 10.9.2"

Up to 16 repetitions is introduced for a Msg3 PUSCH transmission scheduled by RAR UL grant or DCI format 0_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI. This is beneficial to enhance the coverage on both NUL and SUL. After carrier selection and BWP selection during the RACH initialization procedure, a UE requests repetition of Msg3 PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant via separate PRACH resource when the RSRP of DL path-loss reference fulfils a configured threshold. If requested by the UE, gNB decides whether or not to schedule repetition of the Msg3 PUSCH transmission. If scheduled, the number of repetitions N is indicated by the 2 MSBs of the MCS field in the RAR UL grant or in the DCI format 0_0; and the MCS index used for the PUSCH transmission is indicated by the 2 LSBs of the MCS field in the RAR UL grant or by the 3 LSBs of the MCS field in the DCI format 0_0. The Msg3 PUSCH transmission is performed over N slots, which is counted based on available slots. Only inter-slot frequency hopping is supported if N>1 is indicated for the PUSCH transmission. "

900022 Study on Charging Aspect of 5G LAN-type Services FS_5GLAN_CH S5 SP-201081 CHEN SHAN, Huawei

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in SP-220572.

Note: 	Although Studies are usually not reported in this document, it was estimated by the rapporteur that this study deserves a summary. 

As per the 5G LAN-type service requirements specified in TS 22.261 and the 5G LAN-type Services specified in the TS 23.501 and TS 23.502, the 5G Virtual Network (VN) group consists of a set of UEs using private communication for 5G LAN-type services. The WID 5GLAN_CH specifies the charging principle, charging requirements, service operations and charging information for 5G VN group service charging, including:"
question 3579,What does determinism refer to in communication? [3GPP Release 19],The stability of the delay between transmission and receipt of messages,The periodicity of communication intervals,The time-criticality of communication,The availability of communication services,The bounded variation of transmission intervals,option 1: The stability of the delay between transmission and receipt of messages,Determinism in communication refers to whether the delay between transmission of a message and receipt of the message at the destination address is stable.,Standards specifications,3579,1,"Determinism refers to whether the delay between transmission of a message and receipt of the message at the destination address is stable (within bounds). Usually, communication is called deterministic if it is bounded by a given threshold for the latency/transmission time. In case of a periodic transmission, the variation of the interval is bounded.

4.4	Control systems and related communication patterns

There are preferences in the mapping between the type of control and the communication pattern. Open-loop control is characterised by one or many messages sent to an actuator. These can be sent in a periodic or an aperiodic pattern. However, the communication means used need to be deterministic since typically an activity response from the receiver and/or the receiving application is expected."

HARQ-ACK bundling in HD-FDD: In half-duplex FDD operation, the DL peak rate is limited by the fact that the UE needs to switch to UL in order to transmit HARQ-ACK feedback. This work item introduces HARQ-ACK bundling, where the UE transmits a single HARQ-ACK feedback for multiple DL transport blocks, thereby enabling the UE to incease the portion of subframes that can be used for DL data transmission from 30% to 53% (or to 59% using 10 DL HARQ processes)."
question 3726,What does PDCP packet duplication allow in LTE? [3GPP Release 18],Duplicating the transport blocks for uplink transmission,Sending the same PDCP Protocol Data Unit (PDU) on two independent transmission paths,Reordering the received packets on the receiving side,Ensuring synchronization between multiple devices,,option 2: Sending the same PDCP Protocol Data Unit (PDU) on two independent transmission paths,PDCP packet duplication in LTE allows sending the same PDCP Protocol Data Unit (PDU) on two independent transmission paths to increase reliability.,Standards specifications,3726,2,"PDCP packet duplication is supported in the following cases:

for SRBs using RLC AM;

for DRBs using RLC UM or AM.

For DRBs, duplication can be activated and deactivated by a MAC CE. In addition, for DRBs, PDCP packet duplication can be activated upon configuration by RRC signalling. For SRBs, once duplication is configured, it is always activated.

When PDCP packet duplication is activated, the associated logical channels are restricted to be sent only on certain serving cells to ensure the duplicates are sent on different serving cells. The restriction is lifted when PDCP packet duplication is deactivated. When CA duplication is configured for an SRB, one of the logical channels associated to the SRB is restricted to be sent only on the serving cells including PCell and PSCell.

At the receiver, PDCP enables reordering and duplication detection when PDCP packet duplication is configured."
question 3727,What codec should be preferred over a narrowband codec during codec negotiation? [3GPP Release 17],Opus,G.711,AMR,G.729,,option 1: Opus,"During the codec negotiation, subject to operator policy, a wideband codec (like Opus) should be preferred over a narrowband codec.",Standards specifications,3727,1,"The framework and the initial results for new codecs demonstrate coding performance improvements over H.265/HEVC for some codecs of up to 50%. However, the initial results are not considered mature enough to support concrete recommendations on adding new codecs. The potential addition of any new codec in 3GPP services and specifications requires diligent preparation, including the identification of needs and requirements for different scenarios, as well as a complete characterization against existing codecs. The information in this TR, as well as any new developments in 3GPP with respect to codecs in latest specifications, could serve as a baseline for future work. Such an effort may lead to conclusions on the potential addition of any new codec in 3GPP services and specifications. However, no immediate need has been identified to initiate such follow-up work.

8.1	Key Issue #1: How to improve correctness of NWDAF

For KI#1, it proposes the following principles:

General aspects:

Analytics consumers and AnLF may indicate a ""Use case context"" when subscribing to or requesting analytics or ML model(s), respectively. The values of this parameter will not be standardized. The actions of the NWDAF based on the use case context are out of scope of 3GPP/implementation specific.

NWDAF has the accuracy checking capability of analytics IDs and/or ML models, where NWDAF can store for a period of time the necessary information to determine the analytics IDs and/or ML model accuracy and provide the accuracy information to consumers when requested or use it for its internal processes.

An NWDAF containing AnLF with accuracy checking capability is able to provide or notify the accuracy information of Analytics IDs to the consumers of such service."
question 3883,What is the inter RAT mobility characteristic of handover from E-UTRA to NR? [3GPP Release 17],Radio resources are prepared in the source RAT before the handover,In-sequence and lossless handover is supported,Both Xn and NG based inter-RAT handover are not supported,The source RAT configures Target RAT measurement and reporting,Inter RAT measurements are limited to E-UTRA,option 4: The source RAT configures Target RAT measurement and reporting,"In inter-RAT handover from E-UTRA to NR, the source RAT configures Target RAT measurement and reporting.",Standards specifications,3883,4,"9.3.1.2	Handover

Inter RAT mobility is characterised by the following:

The Source RAT configures Target RAT measurement and reporting.

The source RAT decides on the preparation initiation and provides the necessary information to the target RAT in the format required by the target RAT:

question 3918,What is the redundancy version number used for the initial transmission or autonomous retransmission of an initial transport block for a PUSCH transmission? [3GPP Release 17],0,1,2,3,repK-RV,option 1: 0,The redundancy version number used for the initial transmission or autonomous retransmission of an initial transport block for a PUSCH transmission is 0.,Standards specifications,3918,1,"

A single Transport Block (TB) using a resource allocated over multiple slots is introduced for PUSCH except Msg3. A UE scheduled to perform a TBoMS transmission, via either dynamic or configured grant (Type 2), uses the resource allocated across multiple slots to calculate the transport block size (TBS) for the transmission. Advantages of this approach as compared to single-slot PUSCH operations are in the form of lower effective coding rate and/or energy per resource element (EPRE) increase, both advantages leading to coverage enhancement. A TBoMS transmission can be performed w/ or w/o repetition, where a TBoMS transmission w/o repetition is referred to as single TBoMS transmission. The number of slots allocated for TBoMS is counted based on available slots. The UE transmits the TB across the slots determined as available for the TBoMS transmission, applying the same symbol and PRBs allocation in each slot, regardless of whether TBoMS is scheduled w/ or w/o repetition. Collision handling rules of Type A PUSCH repetition apply for TBoMS. TBS of a single TBoMS transmission is calculated using the resource in all the slots allocated for the single TBoMS transmission. The maximum supported TBS for TBoMS does not exceed legacy maximum supported TBS in Rel-15/16, for the same number of layers. TBoMS supports the transmission of only one layer and one code block. A single redundancy version (RV) is used for the transmission of a single TBoMS, irrespective of the number of slots allocated for a single TBoMS transmission, as per Figure 1. RV cycling is used across repetitions of a single TBoMS, as per Figure 2 . Rate Matching (RM) for TBoMS is performed per slot."

These mechanisms include the functionality provided by various network elements, the communication between them and the storage of associated data. This TS provides a conceptual description of a service architecture and architecture requirements which aim to provide service capabilities. It is intended that these standardised capabilities should provide a defined platform which will enable the support of speech, video, multi-media, messaging, data, teleservices, user applications and supplementary services and enable the market for services to be determined by users and home environments."

Summary based on the input provided by Nokia in SP-220631.

In network management files are used for storing and transferring different kinds of data (performance measurements, trace data, etc.). Files are transferred between Network Functions and Management Functions or between Management Functions, depending on the use case. Two different types of file transfer are addressed:

question 4103,What does the Scheduling request feature in NB-IoT allow a connected mode UE to do? [3GPP Release 15],Trigger a random access procedure for UL resource allocation,Configure periodic NPUSCH resources for BSR transmission,Send a request to the eNB to be granted NPUSCH resources,Receive a grant for EDT if pending data is smaller than a maximum permitted size,Reduce the system acquisition time for the UE,option 3: Send a request to the eNB to be granted NPUSCH resources,The Scheduling request feature allows a connected mode UE to send a request to the eNB to be granted NPUSCH resources to send a buffer status report (BSR).,Standards overview,4103,3,"In Rel-13/14 NB-IoT, scheduling request (SR) exists only as a higher-layer procedure, which triggers a random access procedure to request sufficient UL resource to send a buffer status report (BSR). Rel-15 has added new, more resource and power efficient, ways to achieve this goal which can be configured by the eNB.

For a connected mode UE, eNB is able to configure by RRC periodic NPUSCH resources for the UE to send BSR, so the eNB is informed when pending traffic has arrived in the UE's buffer. The resources are activated and de-activated ('released') by dynamic signalling on NPDCCH.

A connected mode UE is able to send, in the physical layer, a request to the eNB to be granted NPUSCH resources to send a BSR. This can be done either by a dedicated signal using a pre-configured NPRACH transmission, or via 'piggybacking' the request onto HARQ ACK or NACK transmission from the UE if one is available, by applying a cover code to the ACK or NACK symbols.

Early data transmission (FDD)"
question 4113,What is used to carry HARQ feedback over the sidelink?

In addition, it supports blind re-transmission schemes, which are described in clauses 6.3.2.1 and 6.3.2.2 on resource allocation modes 1 and 2, respectively.

When ACK/NACK (or DTX) operation is used, the sidelink HARQ procedure is similar to the Uu scheme for non-codeblock group feedback, i.e. the HARQ feedback is transmitted based on the success or failure of the whole transport block."

Support of Carrier Aggregation (CA) for mode-4. CA was already supported for mode-3 in Rel-14. In Rel-15, CA for mode-4 was specified. The resource allocation procedure of Rel-14, which was based on sensing, was expanded to support multi-carrier transmission, while relying on the same core principles. Rules for power sharing, and to include priority were derived. A synchronization procedure for multiple carriers was derived. It includes priority rules for determining the synchronization resources. Sidelink packet duplication was introduced in the case of CA to improve the transmission reliability.

Support for 64-QAM. New transport block sizes and transport block size scaling were introduced to support 64-QAM. In addition, transmission uses rate-matching instead of the Rel-14 procedure where the last symbol was punctured."

The receiving NG-RAN node should act accordingly.

The solution also builds upon the possibility for an NG-RAN node to page certain UEs (e.g., stationary UEs) in RRC_INACTIVE state on a limited set of beams, instead of paging on all the beams within the cell. It is up to the gNB's implementation to select the UEs in RRC_INACTIVE for which paging in limited set of beams applies. If the paging over the limited set of beams fails, the gNB performs subsequent paging by implementation, e.g., by ensuring the same paging message is repeated in all the transmitted SSB beams.

29.1	General

The intention of service exposure is that, under the assumption of a service agreement between MNO and a 3rd party, the 3GPP Network allows a 3rd party service provider to benefit from network provided services and capabilities that are exposed by the PLMN. For example the 3GPP Core Network can exchange information with the 3rd party to optimize usage and management of 3GPP resources. A standardized exposure of network services/capabilities reduces the complexity of different 3rd parties to access different 3GPP network services and capabilities.

General requirements for service exposure with 3rd party service providers:

The operator shall be able to provide to a 3rd party service provider secure and chargeable access to the exposed services/capabilities i.e. to authenticate, authorize and charge the 3rd party entities.

Direct data forwarding is performed directly between the source and target RAN, without the involvement of any UPF to forward the data.

Indirect data forwarding during handovers between 5GS and EPS is supported as follows (see 3GPP TS 38.300 [42]):

For 5G to 4G handover, the source NG-RAN node sends one or several end markers including one QFI of those QoS flows mapped to the same E-RAB and sends the end marker packets to the UPF over the PDU session tunnel. UPF removes the QFI and maps to an appropriate E-RAB tunnel towards SGW.

For 4G to 5G handover, the source eNB forwards the received end markers in the EPS bearer tunnel to the SGW which forwards them to the UPF. The UPF adds one QFI among the QoS flows mapped to that E-RAB to the end markers and sends those end markers to the target NG-RAN node in the per PDU session tunnel."

The MCCH information (i.e. information transmitted in messages sent over MCCH) is transmitted periodically, using a configurable repetition period and within a configured transmission window. MCCH transmissions (and the associated radio resources and MCS) are indicated via the PDCCH addressed to MCCH-RNTI. PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) for MCCH transmission are determined according to the common search space indicated by searchspaceMCCH. If searchspaceMCCH is set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for MCCH message reception in the MCCH transmission window are the same as PDCCH monitoring occasions for SIB1 where the mapping between PDCCH monitoring occasions and SSBs is specified in TS 38.213[13]. If searchspaceMCCH is not set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for MCCH message are determined based on search space indicated by searchspaceMCCH. PDCCH monitoring occasions for MCCH message which are not overlapping with UL symbols (determined according to tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon) are sequentially numbered from one in the MCCH transmission window. The [x×N+K]th PDCCH monitoring occasion for MCCH message in MCCH transmission window corresponds to the Kth transmitted SSB, where x = 0, 1, ...X-1, K = 1, 2, …N, N is the number of actual transmitted SSBs determined according to ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 and X is equal to CEIL(number of PDCCH monitoring occasions in MCCH transmission window/N). The actual transmitted SSBs are sequentially numbered from one in ascending order of their SSB indexes. The UE assumes that, in the MCCH transmission window, PDCCH for an MCCH message is transmitted in at least one PDCCH monitoring occasion corresponding to each transmitted SSB and thus the selection of SSB for the reception MCCH messages is up to UE implementation."

The extensions of the ""Reason"" header field were discussed within this WID to maintain a global consistency on the header format and to make decisions concerning the way it has been extended, and in which standardization body (3GPP or IETF), with a complete view of the benefit it could yield for all 3GPP requirements.

The ""Reason"" header has been extended with:

a new protocol value FAILURE_CAUSE to be used in SIP error responses; and

a new header field parameter to provide the Q.850 location parameter in SIP (new IETF Internet-Draft).

question 5151,What does redundant transmission at the transport layer in URLLC require?

Industrial requirements for supporting redundant transports for URLLC are specified in clause 5.33.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [6] with dual connectivity based end to end redundant user paths. Rel-16 URLLC work in 5GS is limited to URSP solutions assuming that the UE's application layer or operating system supports duplication of the traffic and provides two distinct traffic descriptors for the two redundant traffic. How to initiate the establishment procedure and how to use the redundant user plane path are not defined yet (now they are up to the upper layer implementation). For example, the UE may use the implementation of FRER (Frame Replication and Elimination for Reliability), IEEE 802.1CB-2017 [14], in the UE's upper layer protocols (i.e. application layer or operating system layer), to establish two redundant PDU Sessions and manage the replication and elimination of redundant packets/frames. However, redundant implementation on upper layer protocols is not always available for application clients and application servers. In those cases where application client and application server support is not available for redundant implementation, the application enablement layer (with SEALDD client and SEALDD server) can support this functionality for the application. For the verticals/enterprises, it is a better choice to use the SEALDD service for the interaction with 5GC and management of the replication and elimination of redundant packets so as to remove the complication from the application.

The main functionalities include the discovery and re-discover of Edge Application Server (EAS), edge relocation, network exposure to EAS, support of 3GPP application layer architecture for enabling Edge Computing, and AF guidance to determination of URSP rules.

The outputs of corresponding study phase are documented in TR 23.748[2].

Discovery and re-discovery of Edge Application Server: Before an UE accessing to edge service, a suitable EAS needs to be discovered by the UE considering different factors, e.g. UE location, UPF serving the UE and also the EAS deployment. When one of the above factors changes due to e.g. UE mobility, the EAS needs to be re-discovered to keep the path optimized."

GNSS carrier phase positioning has been used very successfully for centimetre-level positioning but is limited to outdoor applications. NR carrier phase positioning has the potential for significant performance improvements for indoor and outdoor deployments in comparison with the existing NR positioning methods, as well as shorter latency and lower UE power consumption in comparison with RTK-GNSS outdoors."

RF aspects of PRS/SRS bandwidth aggregation for intra-band contiguous carriers is studied by RAN4. Based on the study, PRS/SRS bandwidth aggregation for intra-band contiguous carriers is concluded as feasible for single chain Tx/Rx architectures at both the UE and gNB.

The assumption for a single-chain Tx architecture is that PRS/SRS resources to be aggregated are transmitted from a single Tx antenna.

6.2.1.2	RRM aspects

From the perspective of Radio Resource Management (RRM), the following are assumed for PRS bandwidth aggregation:

A common numerology is required across all intra-band contiguous PFLs to be aggregated.

PRS resources to be aggregated from different PFLs can have different bandwidths (i.e., different number of PRS RBs).

PRS resources to be aggregated from different PFLs are transmitted in the same slot and in the same symbols."

For KI#1, it proposes the following principles:

General aspects:

Analytics consumers and AnLF may indicate a ""Use case context"" when subscribing to or requesting analytics or ML model(s), respectively. The values of this parameter will not be standardized. The actions of the NWDAF based on the use case context are out of scope of 3GPP/implementation specific.

NWDAF has the accuracy checking capability of analytics IDs and/or ML models, where NWDAF can store for a period of time the necessary information to determine the analytics IDs and/or ML model accuracy and provide the accuracy information to consumers when requested or use it for its internal processes.

An NWDAF containing AnLF with accuracy checking capability is able to provide or notify the accuracy information of Analytics IDs to the consumers of such service."

question 5451,What is the term for the interference between UL and DL transmissions in different cells due to atmospheric ducting? [3GPP Release 18],RIM interference,Backhaul-based interference,CLI interference,Remote interference,Semi-static interference,option 4: Remote interference,The interference between UL and DL transmissions in different cells due to atmospheric ducting is termed as remote interference.,Standards specifications,5451,4,"The atmospheric ducting phenomenon, caused by lower densities at higher altitudes in the Earth's atmosphere, causes a reduced refractive index, causing the signals to bend back towards the Earth. A signal trapped in the atmospheric duct can reach distances far greater than normal. In TDD networks with the same UL/DL slot configuration, and in the absence of atmospheric ducting, a guard period is used to avoid the interference between UL and DL transmissions in different cells. However, when the atmospheric ducting phenomenon happens, radio signals can travel a relatively long distance, and the propagation delay exceeds the guard period. Consequently, the DL signals of an aggressor cell can interfere with the UL signals of a victim cell that is far away from the aggressor. Such interference is termed as remote interference.

The information in this TR, as well as any new developments in 3GPP with respect to codecs in latest specifications, could serve as a baseline for future work. Such an effort may lead to conclusions on the potential addition of any new codec in 3GPP services and specifications. However, no immediate need has been identified to initiate such follow-up work.

As for the system-wide features, presented in sections 5 to 18, the overall trend in Rel-16 is to make the 3GPP 5G System (5GS) a communication-enabling platform suitable for a wide range of industries (“verticals”), such as e.g. transportation (autonomous driving V2X, Railways, Maritime), automated factories, healthcare, public safety and many more. In this respect, the versatility and reliability of the 5GS has been further increased to make it industry-grade compatible, with enhancements to Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), Network Slicing, Edge Computing, Cellular IoT (Internet of Things), Non-Public Networks, Positioning Services and LAN-type services. In addition, the use of 5G as an underlying communication network (i.e. to be used transparently by applications external to the network) has been enhanced, mostly under the work on ""Northbound APIs"". Besides all these industrial aspects, other Rel-16 enhancements cover the coexistence of 5G with non-3GPP systems, entertainment (e.g. streaming and media distribution) and network optimisations (e.g. user identity)."

However, the initial results are not considered mature enough to support concrete recommendations on adding new codecs. The potential addition of any new codec in 3GPP services and specifications requires diligent preparation, including the identification of needs and requirements for different scenarios, as well as a complete characterization against existing codecs. The information in this TR, as well as any new developments in 3GPP with respect to codecs in latest specifications, could serve as a baseline for future work. Such an effort may lead to conclusions on the potential addition of any new codec in 3GPP services and specifications. However, no immediate need has been identified to initiate such follow-up work.

question 5909,What is the architecture called when the 5G AN is connected to the 4G Core Network? [3GPP Release 15],EN-DC,Stand-Alone (SA),Non-Stand Alone (NSA),E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity,,option 3: Non-Stand Alone (NSA),The architecture called when the 5G Access Network is connected to the 4G Core Network is Non-Stand Alone (NSA).,Standards overview,5909,3,"Figure 5.3.3-1: The SA Architecture

The SA architecture can be seen as the ""full 5G deployment"", not needing any part of a 4G network to operate. 

The NR base station (logical node ""gNB"") connects with each other via the Xn interface, and the Access Network (called the ""NG-RAN for SA architecture"") connects to the 5GC network using the NG interface.

The continuation of this section refers to the SA architecture, the NSA being addressed in a subsequent, dedicated, section.

5.3.3	Overview of the Core Network

In the SA deployment option, the 5G System (5GS) is composed of the User Equipment, the Access Network (including the ""New Radio"" or NR) and the Core Network (5GC or 5GCN).

The service requirements, as presented in the previous clause, were used as a basis to define the architecture. The architecture specification (a.k.a. Stage 2) started with a preliminary study in TR 23.799 [4], also called ""NextGen TR"", before being fully specified in TS 23.501 [1], TS 23.502 [2] and TS 23.503 [3]."
question 5913,What is the purpose of an Application Group ID?

question 5915,How many SSB bursts are used for Loop convergence in the CONNECTED state? [3GPP Release 16],1,2,3,4,5,option 2: 2,2 SSB bursts are used for Loop convergence in the CONNECTED state.,Standards specifications,5915,2,"This solution describes how to extend Annex E of TS 33.501 to achieve this functionality in KI #3 (in bold) so that UEs avoid FBS both in IDLE and CONNECTED mode. 

The basic idea behind this solution is based on the cell search procedure where a UE has to acquire the synchronization signal block (SSB). SSBs are transmitted in a burst, where different SSB in the burst have a different identifier (SB#) and each SSB is transmitted in a beam in a different direction. The maximum number of SSBs in a SS burst beams depends on the frequency. There are up to 4 SSBs if the frequency is under 3 GHz, up to 8 SSBs if the frequency is between 3 and 6 GHz, and up to 64 SSBs for frequencies higher than 6 GHz. Depending on the relative position of the UE with regard to a base station, the UE will measure a different power level for different beams. The UE will use the beam with the highest received power.

question 5919,What is the purpose of the Restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage feature? [3GPP Release 14],To allocate extensive resources from the network for specific subscribers,To enable the operator to restrict specific subscribers from using Enhanced Coverage,To provide enhanced coverage functionality for both data and voice centric UEs,To prevent the MME from sending the Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter to the UE,,option 2: To enable the operator to restrict specific subscribers from using Enhanced Coverage,The Restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage feature allows the operator to prevent specific subscribers from using Enhanced Coverage.,Standards overview,5919,2,"

The support of UEs in Enhanced Coverage is specified in TS 36.300. The usage of Enhanced Coverage may require use of extensive resources (e.g. radio and signalling resources) from the network. This feature enables the operator to prevent specific subscribers from using Enhanced Coverage. The Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter is introduced as part of the subscription data in the HSS that specifies per PLMN whether the enhanced coverage functionality is restricted or not for the UE. The MME receives Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter from the HSS. If the UE includes the support for restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage, the MME sends the Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter to the UE in the Attach/TAU Accept message. The UE uses the value of Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter to determine if the enhanced coverage feature is restricted or not. The MME also provides an Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter to the eNB via S1 signalling whenever the UE context is established in the RAN, e.g., during service request procedure, attach procedure, and TAU procedure. The Restriction of use of the Enhanced Coverage is specified in TS 23.060 and TS 23.401. The support for Enhanced Coverage (i.e. CE Mode B) for both ""data centric"" and ""voice centric"" UEs is specified in TS 23.401 and TS 23.228."
question 5920,Is the deployment of a NAT between EASDF and PSA UPF supported? [3GPP Release 18],"Yes, it is supported","No, it is not supported",It depends on the configuration of the EASDF,It depends on the type of UE,Both option 2 and 3,"option 2: No, it is not supported",The deployment of a NAT between EASDF and PSA UPF is not supported.,Standards specifications,5920,2,"A UE that has an established MA-PDU session over non-3GPP access in 5GC and 3GPP access in EPS, may be able to use EN-DC for the 3GPP access leg.

Depending on the RAT types supported by the UE, the PDN connection may also be handed over to 3GPP access in 5GC. For a UE supporting both E-UTRAN/EPC access and NG-RAN/5GC access, the user plane resources for 3GPP access may be moved between E-UTRAN/EPC access and NG-RAN/5GC access as described in clause 5.17.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. The PDU Session and User Plane resources active over non-3GPP access are not affected by such inter 3GPP access RAT change.

4.22.2.3.3	QoS Support

The general principles for QoS support with ATSSS as described in clause 5.32.4 of TS 23.501 [2], apply, with the clarifications provided in this clause.

With an MA PDU Session associated to a PDN Connection on EPS there may be separate user-plane tunnels between the AN and the PGW-U+UPF, one associated with 3GPP access in EPC and one associated with non-3GPP access in 5GS."
question 5923,What is the purpose of selecting an appropriate relay UE? [3GPP Release 17],To improve energy efficiency,To improve coverage,To improve energy efficiency and coverage,No specific purpose,,option 3: To improve energy efficiency and coverage,Selecting an appropriate relay UE can help improve the energy efficiency and coverage of the system.,Standards specifications,5923,3,"Figure 1: Scenarios for UE-to-Network Relay

Common aspect for both L2 and L3 U2N Relay

In order to enable remote UE and relay UE to identify each other and to establish sidelink connection, the scheme of sidelink discovery is introduced, including protocol stack design, interest report to network and etc. Further mechanism is adopted to enable network to configure the Uu RSRP threshold to (dis)allow remote / relay UE operation at specific cell location.

Figure 2: Protocol Stack of Discovery Message for UE-to-Network Relay

In order for remote UE to connection to the proper relay UE, relay (re)selection mechanism is introduced, in order for remote UE to base on the sidelink link quality to select proper relay UE. And relay UE can indicate the even of Uu link (e.g., Uu link disconnection or Uu link mobility) to remote UE, so that remote UE can decide whether to perform relay reselection."
question 5926,When does the UE ignore the scheduling DCI for the n-th triggered CSI report? [3GPP Release 17],If the first uplink symbol to carry the n-th CSI report starts earlier than at symbol Z'ref(n),If the PUSCH indicated by the DCI is overlapping with another PUCCH or PUSCH,If the number of triggered reports is one and no HARQ-ACK or transport block is multiplexed on the PUSCH,If the first uplink symbol to carry the corresponding CSI report(s) starts earlier than at symbol Zref,If the PDCCH reception includes two PDCCH candidates from two respective search space sets,option 1: If the first uplink symbol to carry the n-th CSI report starts earlier than at symbol Z'ref(n),"If the first uplink symbol to carry the n-th CSI report starts earlier than at symbol Z'ref(n), the UE may ignore the scheduling DCI if the number of triggered reports is one and no HARQ-ACK or transport block is multiplexed on the PUSCH.",Standards specifications,5926,1,"in CSI-ReportConfig for the  triggered CSI Reporting Settings and  is the (m+1)th entry of  including the omitted CSI Reporting Settings triggered for non-active DL BWPs, where the UE does not expect that (m+1) is larger than 16.

question 5947,What does scheduling the periods of location monitoring and reporting help reduce? [3GPP Release 17],Quality of Service (QoS),Network traffic,Asset management services,Privacy Exception List,PLMN operator services,option 2: Network traffic,Scheduling the periods of location monitoring and reporting helps reduce network traffic.,Standards specifications,5947,2,"A method of reducing this time is to require the MS to establish radio contact with the network at intervals, purely to confirm its location, if the MS does not move to a new location area (which would lead to a normal location registration) or respond to paging for a mobile terminated call or request a mobile originated call or call-independent supplementary service activity.

The interval between successive periodic location updatings is controlled by a timer in the MS; this timer is reset to its initial value at the end of each successfully established radio contact between the MS and the network.

The use of the periodic location update timer is described in 3GPP TS 23.122 [27].

Unlike other consumer multimedia applications envisioned for 3GPP systems, the applications in which this document focuses have more demanding performance targets and includes user devices that are managed in different workflows when compared to typical UEs.

This can be divided into two main categories: contribution and production. 

Contribution links are heavily compressed and have lower latency requirements and are used for newsgathering and other programme items. They are currently serviced by satellite or bonded cellular and use the PLMNs

Production links have higher bandwidth, due to less compression, and challenging latency requirements as well as strict Quality of Service metrics to ensure reliability.

4.1	Purpose

Under certain circumstances, it will be desirable to prevent UE users from making access attempts (including emergency call attempts) or responding to pages in specified areas of a PLMN. Such situations may arise during states of emergency, or where 1 of 2 or more co-located PLMNs has failed.

Broadcast messages should be available on a cell by cell basis indicating the class(es) or categories of subscribers barred from network access.

The use of these facilities allows the network operator to prevent overload of the access channel under critical conditions.

It is not intended that access control be used under normal operating conditions.

It should be possible to differentiate access control between CS and PS domains. Details are specified in TS23.122[3] and TS25.304 [10]. Not all RATs need to support this functionality.

Flexible network operations are the mainstay of the 5G system. The capabilities to provide this flexibility include network slicing, network capability exposure, scalability, and diverse mobility. Other network operations requirements address the necessary control and data plane resource efficiencies, as well as network configurations that optimize service delivery by minimizing routing between end users and application servers. Enhanced charging and security mechanisms handle new types of UEs connecting to the network in different ways. The enhanced flexibility of the 5G system also allows to cater to the needs of various verticals. For example, the 5G system introduces the concept of non-public networks providing exclusive access for a specific set of users and specific purpose(s). Non-public networks can, depending on deployment and (national) regulations, support different subsets of 5G functionality. In this specification 5G network requirements apply to both NPNs and PLMNs, unless specified otherwise. Additionally, there are specific requirements dedicated only to NPNs or PLMNs, which are indicated accordingly. More information can be found in Section 6.25."

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in RP-180862.

LTE connectivity to 5G-CN does not only allow RAN level interworking but provides a migration path where the core network is 5G-CN whereas the radio remains LTE. This enables utilization of new functionalities provided by the 5G-CN such as QoS, mobility enhancements and slicing even when using the LTE radio interface."

In an LTE system there are multiple components contributing to the total end to end delay for connected UEs. The limitations in performance are in general use case dependent; for which e.g. UL latency may influence the DL application performance and vice versa.

In general, a UE with data to send has to send a Scheduling Request (SR) to receive a UL scheduling grant before transmitting the data packet. In order to send a SR, a UE has to wait for a SR-valid PUCCH resource and a corresponding scheduling grant transmitted on PDCCH to the UE in response. When the grant on PDCCH is decoded, the data transmission can start over PUSCH."

[3GPP Release 14],Improving WLAN coverage,Enhancing security for WLAN access,Optimizing WLAN connection speed,,,option 2: Enhancing security for WLAN access,The purpose of this feature is to enhance security for WLAN access through the support of the EAP Re-authentication Protocol.,Standards specifications,6590,2,"The procedures for access to 3GPP Evolved Packet Core (EPC) via non-3GPP access networks have been enhanced in Rel-14 to enable an EPC network to optionally support the EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP). ERP allows efficient re-authentication between the UE and a dedicated server that can be located in the TWAP or the 3GPP AAA proxy/server and provides optimized link-setup delay after handover between access points.

The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) (IETF RFC 6696 [1]) is used for authentication of user accessing EPC using non-3GPP access networks. To avoid full EAP authentication when moving from one access point to another one of the same access network, ERP has been defined to ensure efficient re-authentication between the UE and an EAP re-authentication server through any access point."

After successful reception by the eNB, the random access procedure terminates and the UE does not transition to connected mode.",Standards overview,6592,1,"In Rel-13/14 NB-IoT, scheduling request (SR) exists only as a higher-layer procedure, which triggers a random access procedure to request sufficient UL resource to send a buffer status report (BSR). Rel-15 has added new, more resource and power efficient, ways to achieve this goal which can be configured by the eNB.

For a connected mode UE, eNB is able to configure by RRC periodic NPUSCH resources for the UE to send BSR, so the eNB is informed when pending traffic has arrived in the UE's buffer. The resources are activated and de-activated ('released') by dynamic signalling on NPDCCH.

A connected mode UE is able to send, in the physical layer, a request to the eNB to be granted NPUSCH resources to send a BSR. This can be done either by a dedicated signal using a pre-configured NPRACH transmission, or via 'piggybacking' the request onto HARQ ACK or NACK transmission from the UE if one is available, by applying a cover code to the ACK or NACK symbols.

With the foreseen deployment of more NR base stations, e.g., small base stations with massive MIMO in high-band, energy saving becomes even more urgent and challenging."
question 6682,How is traffic routing influenced for a 5G VN group? [3GPP Release 18],By configuring the UPFs with N19 tunnels,By providing information and DNAIs in an AF request,By establishing VLAN tags for Ethernet PDU Sessions,By selecting a dedicated SMF for the 5G VN group,By subscribing to notification of group status changes,option 2: By providing information and DNAIs in an AF request,"The AF can influence traffic routing for a 5G VN group by providing information and DNAIs in an AF request sent to the PCF, which then configures the SMF accordingly.",Standards specifications,6682,2,"The details of the PDR and FAR setting over N4 for unicast traffic forwarding within a 5G VN are specified in clauses 5.8.2.13.1 and 5.8.2.13.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].

The details of the PDR and FAR setting over N4 for broadcast traffic forwarding within a 5G VN are specified in clause 5.8.2.13.3 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].

If a PIN has more than one PEGCs, 5G VN Group Communication may be used for the PIN as specified in clause 5.44.3 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28]. In this case, separation of multiple PINs communication in the UPF uses different network instances as it is for 5G VN Group.

The UPF local switching may be applied to PIN indirect communication when there are multiple PDU sessions for a PIN from different PEGCs connecting to the same UPF. The N6-based forwarding may be applied to PIN-DN communication.

Some URLLC services request very high reliability that hardly can be supported in an economical way by a single transport path. To support such services, a redundant transmission mechanism is specified. User packets are duplicated and simultaneously transferred to the receiver via two disjoint user plane paths. The redundant packets are then eliminated at the receiver side.

5	Recommendations

In this study, we have identified the need to define a network based solution which aims at verifying the reported UE location information.

question 7517,What is the difference between reliability and communication service availability? [3GPP Release 19],"Reliability is the ability to meet specific KPIs, while communication service availability refers to the system properties of 5G systems","Reliability is the stability of the delay between transmission and receipt of messages, while communication service availability refers to the stability of the end-to-end latency","Reliability is the ability of a system to perform its required functions under stated conditions, while communication service availability refers to the proportion of time a service is available for use","Reliability is the bounded variation of transmission intervals, while communication service availability refers to the bounded variation of the interval between transmissions","Reliability is the predetermined output of an open-loop control system, while communication service availability refers to the control of physical processes","option 3: Reliability is the ability of a system to perform its required functions under stated conditions, while communication service availability refers to the proportion of time a service is available for use","Reliability refers to the ability of a system to perform its required functions under stated conditions, while communication service availability refers to the proportion of time a service is available for use.",Standards specifications,7517,3,"Annex F (informative):
Relation of reliability and communication service availability

Availability and reliability are used both in 3GPP and vertical industries, but with different meanings. Communication service availability addresses the availability of a communication service. This definition follows the vertical standard IEC 61907 [7]. On the other hand, reliability is a 3GPP term and addresses the availability of a communication network. The relation of both terms is depicted in figure F-1 for a mobile network.

Figure F-1: Illustration of the concepts reliability and communication service availability.

As depicted, reliability covers the communication-related aspects between two nodes (here: end nodes), while communication service availability addresses the communication-related aspects between two communication service interfaces. This might seem to be a small difference, but this difference can lead to situations, where reliability and communication service availability have different values."

For the reduction of packet loss due to BH RLF, Rel-17 introduces the BH RLF detection indication and the RLF recovery indication. In case an IAB-node attempts RRC Reestablishment due to BH RLF, it can send the RLF detection indication to each child node. If the child node has an alternative backhaul path available, it can apply UL rerouting for upstream packets. If it has no such alternative backhaul path, it can propagate the BH RLF detection indication to the next tier. When the IAB-node has recovered from the BH RLF, it can send the RLF recovery indication to each child node, which revokes all behaviour triggered by the BH RLF detection indication before. The BH RLF recovery indication is propagated in the same manner as the BH RLF detection indication.

A method to adjust ∆thermal value in Noc setting methodology can increase max achievable DL SNR. ∆thermal is the actual difference between UE thermal noise level and wanted noise level. The difference between these levels leads to the difference between baseband SNR and SNR at the reference point. According to the FR2-1 SNR calculation methodology, 6 dB ∆thermal is used that corresponds to 1 dB SNR difference. 

Table 7.2.3-2 below provides evaluations how ∆thermal impacts DL SNR. For simplicity the ∆thermal value is recalculated to allowed SNR difference (allowed noise increase). 400 MHz CBW and -13 dB backoff from P1dB were selected for the analysis.

For the reduction of packet loss due to BH RLF, Rel-17 introduces the BH RLF detection indication and the RLF recovery indication. In case an IAB-node attempts RRC Reestablishment due to BH RLF, it can send the RLF detection indication to each child node. If the child node has an alternative backhaul path available, it can apply UL rerouting for upstream packets. If it has no such alternative backhaul path, it can propagate the BH RLF detection indication to the next tier. When the IAB-node has recovered from the BH RLF, it can send the RLF recovery indication to each child node, which revokes all behaviour triggered by the BH RLF detection indication before. The BH RLF recovery indication is propagated in the same manner as the BH RLF detection indication.
