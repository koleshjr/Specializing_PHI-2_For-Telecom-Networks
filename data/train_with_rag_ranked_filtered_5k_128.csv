question 14,"In online charging, how are chargeable events transformed into charging events? [3GPP Release 18]",By the CTF,By the OCF,By the CGF,By the CHF,,option 2: By the OCF,The CTF transforms each chargeable event into a charging event and forwards these charging events to the OCF in real-time.,Standards specifications,14,2,"

ASs may support a multitude of services which are not specified in 3GPP standards. Therefore it is not possible to standardise charging flows and procedures for those services. However, for all such services, the AS may apply either event charging, where Charging Data Request [event] messages are generated, or Session Charging, using Charging Data Request [start, stop and interim]. The following clauses depict one example for each of the two scenarios. The first procedure, AS acting as a redirect server, depicts the ""event"" case, while the second procedure, AS acting as a voice mail server, depicts the ""session"" case.","

An open Rf or Ga interface is not specified for MMS in the 3GPP standards, hence no charging events (Rf message flows) are specified in clause 5.2.2. 
In clause 5.2.3, CDR generation is described in relation to the chargeable event triggers specified in clause 5.1, given that there is a 1:1 relation all the way from chargeable event to CDR type as explained in the first paragraph above. However, due to the absence of a standard Ga interface for MMS, from the 3GPP specifications perspective these CDRs are only visible in CDR files crossing the Bm interface.","

The online,offline charging and converged charging can be categorised into two distinct classes, namely event based charging and session based charging. Event based charging implies that a chargeable event is defined as a single end-user-to-network transaction, e.g. the sending of a multimedia message. This chargeable event is then mapped to an appropriate charging event, resulting in a single CDR or in a single Credit-Control and resource usage authorisation procedure. In contrast, session based charging is characterised by the existence of a user session, such as a circuit call, an IP CAN bearer, an PDU session, or an IMS session. This user session is then matched by a charging session, resulting in the generation of multiple chargeable/charging events and the creation of one or more CDRs in offline charging/converged charging or the performance of a Credit-Control session in online charging/converged charging. The following paragraphs describe the event versus session based charging in more detail for both online, offline charging. converged charging.","R6.3 - 560	Charging - The 3GPP system shall be able to generate LI charging event records.

The maritime domain, one of the 5G vertical domains in 3GPP, is moving forward with the digitalisation and mobilisation of commercial as well as safety fields. Legacy 3GPP-based technologies and solutions can be beneficial to the digitalisation and mobilisation of the maritime domain though some of the legacy 3GPP enabling technologies and solutions may not be able to fully support the performances required by the maritime domain. The maritime radio environment was not originally considered by 3GPP when the technical specifications and solutions were standardised for LTE and 5G. ","

However, the maritime domain also has specific situations that do not happen in other vertical domains or in the legacy ICT industrial domain. New 3GPP enabling technologies dedicated to the maritime domain can be used to address such specific situations based on requirements derived from maritime use cases.

In 5G radio systems, users in connected mode keep monitoring the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH), which carries scheduling grants transmitted by gNB. This continuous monitoring of the PDCCH forces users to stay in active mode even when there is no traffic to be scheduled, thus resulting in unnecessary power consumption. To mitigate this problem, 5G defines UE power saving schemes including Connected mode DRX (CDRX) and PDCCH monitoring adaptation (e.g. PDCCH skipping and Search Space Set Group switching). Both CDRX and PDCCH monitoring adaptation offer the possibility to reduce UE power consumption by alternating between active and sleep periods, by switching the monitoring frequency of PDCCH, and/or by skipping some of the PDCCH monitoring occasions.","B.2.10	SPS+DG with UE power saving scheme	95

In the Registration procedure (as specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2), when a Multi-USIM UE has more than one USIM active, supports and intends to use one or more Multi-USIM specific features, it indicates to the AMF the corresponding Multi-USIM feature(s) are supported (except for the Paging Timing Collision Control feature). Based on the received indication of the supported Multi-USIM features from the UE, the AMF shall indicate to the UE the support of the Multi-USIM features based on the Multi-USIM features supported by network and any preference policy by the network, if available. When a UE returns to having only one USIM active from a Multi-USIM UE that previously indicated to the network it supported Multi-USIM feature(s), the UE shall indicate all the Multi-USIM features are not supported to the network for that USIM. The AMF shall only indicate the support of Paging Restriction feature together with the support of either Connection Release feature or Reject Paging Request feature.","AMF:

During the Registration procedure, indicate capability for non-3GPP access switching to UE.","

As defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], when interworking procedures with N26 are used, the UE operates in single-registration mode. For the 3GPP access, either the AMF or the MME is registered in the HSS+UDM. This implies that:","

In this option the UE register for the purpose of traffic switching. When the AMF receives the path switching indication from UE, it shall update the SM context of UE in order to trigger the user-plane resources establishment. The registration results would also indicate whether the path switching between two non-3GPP accesses is success or not. Therefore, from the point of view of the whole procedure, the definition of a new registration type is preferred for option 2.","

1.	The UE is registered over 3GPP access and untrusted non-3GPP access and established MA PDU Session. During the MA PDU Session Establishment, the UE indicates whether it supports non-3GPP access switching in the PDU Session Establishment Request message.

The 3GPP system shall be able to provide continuity between CS voice services (Teleservice 11[14]) and the full duplex speech component of IMS multimedia telephony service [40] with no negative impact upon the user's experience of the voice service. This functionality is known as voice call continuity. Voice call continuity shall be executed when continuation of a voice service is required based on operator policy across a change in the connection of the UE to the 3GPP system as the user moves from using the CS domain to using IMS and vice versa.","

Voice call continuity per clause 21 shall be supported when a UE with an active IMS MES with voice and other media moves out of IMS voice coverage and voice call continuity is supported by the UE and network. The remaining media (i.e. voice call) then becomes a CS emergency call e.g. TS12 call for 3GPP systems as defined in 3GPP TS 22.003 [14].","

question 1029,What should URSP rules based on AF guidance not be set as? [3GPP Release 18],Match all traffic descriptor,URSP rules with low priority,URSP rules without traffic descriptor,URSP rules for specific locations,,option 1: Match all traffic descriptor,URSP rules based on AF guidance should not be set with a 'match all' traffic descriptor.,Standards specifications,1029,1,"

For the Session Breakout scenario, only the 3GPP access should be allowed for the EC traffic, because the UL-CL is reachable only through that access, since there are no ATSSS procedures that would ensure that an UL-CL can be on path when the UE connects through a non-3GPP access. Based on the received EC related policy and deployment information the SMF may, however, select an UL-CL based on existing procedures if the UE connects through a 3GPP access. One simple solution to keep the EC traffic to 3GPP access is to set the Access Type Preference to ""3GPP"" in the corresponding URSP rule for this PDU Session. To avoid other, non-EC traffic be constrained to the 3GPP access, WIFI offload can be setup for that traffic using the ""Non-Seamless Offload indication"" as route selection in the corresponding URSP rule. An example URSP rule set is given in table 6.41.2-1. Note that the traffic descriptors in the URSP rules may need to be updated, e.g. based on AF Application guidance for URSP determination, resulting that the updated URSP rules might not be immediately enforced for some ongoing traffic.","

1.	via existing URSP rules: Solution #41 proposes to apply the existing URSP rules to control non-seamless WIFI offload. As stated in clause 6.1.2.2.1 of TS 23.503 [13]: ""If the UE has an URSP rule (except the URSP rule with the ""match all"" Traffic descriptor) that matches the application as defined in clause 6.6.2.3, the UE shall perform the association of the application to the corresponding PDU Session or to Non-Seamless Offload or ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay Offload according to this rule"". That is, if 5GC defines policy rules for non-seamless offload for some traffic in the RSD, then the UE should apply these rules for that traffic in the corresponding PDU Session. For session breakout, if an update of traffic descriptors in URSP rules is required, the resulting rule will possibly not be acted upon by the UE immediately. The ATSSS rules can be configured for more refined control of traffic steering if the conflicting non-3GPP access is integrated. The solution can achieve this outcome without any impacts to the specifications. However, in this solution, the UE is not made aware whether any of the edge enablers are configured for the 3GPP access.","

c)	should use the URSP rules, if available at the UE, to derive the parameters to be used in EPS as specified in clause 4.4.2 for all uplink user data for which there is no applicable ANDSF rule or RAN rule except for the rules and parameters related to non-3GPP access node selection. and there is no applicable UE local configuration",NOTE 14: Handling of URSP rules is specified in 3GPP TS 24.526 [77].,"

The PCF may use the AF guidance received from different AFs, UE subscription data and local operator policy to determine the URSP rules to send to a UE. If received guidance information is not consistent with UE subscription data, or the local operator policy do not allow the specific S-NSSAI and DNN provided by the AF guidance, the corresponding AF guidance shall not be used to determine URSP rules."

E-UTRAN supports E-UTRAN controlled bi-directional traffic steering between E-UTRAN and WLAN for UEs in RRC_CONNECTED: RAN Controlled WLAN Interworking (RCLWI). E-UTRAN may send a steering command to the UE indicating to steer traffic from E-UTRAN to WLAN or from WLAN to E-UTRAN. The upper layers in the UE shall be notified (see TS 24.302 [67]) upon reception of such a command. Upper layers determine which traffic is offloadable to WLAN. Similarly as for LWA, two scenarios are supported depending on the backhaul connection between LTE and WLAN (non-collocated RCLWI scenario for a non-ideal backhaul and collocated RCLWI scenario for an ideal/internal backhaul), and the overall architecture for the non-collocated RCLWI scenario is the same as illustrated for LWA in Figure 22A.1.1-1 above.","

As described in TS 36.300 [5] E-UTRAN may support RAN-Controlled WLAN interworking (RCLWI) for controlling traffic steering between E-UTRAN and WLAN for UEs in RRC_CONNECTED. When E-UTRAN sends an ""offload"" command to the UE, the UE passes an indication to the upper layers indicating that traffic steering to/from WLAN is needed. The upper layers determine to initiate traffic steering to/from WLAN based on the UE capability and the configuration information that has received from NAS layer indicating which PDN connections are offloadable. When the UE receives the ""offload"" command from the EUTRAN, the UE shall perform handover to WLAN only the PDN connections that have been authorized for offloading.",Figure 22A.2.6.1-1: Traffic steering from E-UTRAN to WLAN procedure

In Rel-16, the earlier transmission of UL data payload has been further enhanced by introducing UL transmission using preconfigured uplink resources (PUR). This feature allows eNB to configure uplink resources, in which a UE in IDLE mode can send UL transmission without performing random access procedures. The UE can be potentially configured with a cyclic shift of DMRS, which allows sharing of the preconfigured resources under which up to two users can transmit NPUSCH simultaneously when the NPUSCH transmission is larger than or equal to 64ms for 12-tone allocation. By skipping the random access procedures, the uplink transmission efficiency can be improved and UE power consumption is reduced. Before performing a PUR transmission, the UE must evaluate the validity of the timing advance (TA) based on either individual or combined usage of any of the following attributes: a) serving cell change, b) TA timer, c) RSRP change. Additionally, it is possible to configure the TA as always valid within a given cell.","

Similarly, the UE may consider the priority of a scheduling request (SR) as well as priority of the logical channel which triggered the SR when deciding whether to transmit PUSCH or SR when they overlap in time. Furthermore, if two PUCCHs of different PHY priorities or a PUCCH and a PUSCH of different PHY priorities are overlapping in time on a serving cell, the UE is able to cancel the lower priority transmission with the specified cancellation behaviour and related timeline to allow for transmission of the PUSCH or PUCCH of higher PHY priority.

Load-Balancing without pre-defined split percentages: This introduces enhancements to the Load-Balancing steering mode, which is a steering mode that splits the traffic of a data flow (in uplink and downlink direction separately) across the 3GPP and the non-3GPP accesses. In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages (referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP access, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17, however, the network may provide an ""autonomous load-balance indicator"" in which case the UE and the UPF can freely and independently select their own percentages for each access type. The selected percentages may change over time, e.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select the percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput. This means that using a load-balancing steering mode with the ""autonomous load-balance indicator"" can maximize the throughput of a given data flow in the uplink and in the downlink direction.",,,,

question 1217,What is the purpose of service continuity in the Evolved Packet System?

3GPP TS 23.548 [8] and 3GPP TS 23.558 [10] specifies that, service continuity is required for EAS relocation and service continuity relies on application layer support of seamless context/status relocation between the EAS servers. Transport layer connection re-establishment also causes service interrupts. Thus EAS IP replacement is also discussed in 3GPP TS 23.548 [8], assuming that real-time transport layer relocation is supported between the source EAS and target EAS. However, the real-time context/status relocation and transport layer real-time relocation are not always supported for the verticals/enterprises. In those cases where network support is not available, the application enablement layer can support this functionality for the application. The data delivery enabler service in network can maintain the transport layer connection with corresponding client in the UE. EAS can use such data delivery enabler service for EAS relocation (including context transfer and lossless packet transfer). Such data delivery enabler can ensure the UE's service continuity including seamless data delivery and enhanced transport layer management.","[13]	3GPP TS 22.278, ""Service requirements for the Evolved Packet System (EPS)""","[13]	3GPP TS 22.278, ""Service requirements for the Evolved Packet System (EPS)""","Session continuity, service continuity and UP path management (see clause 4.3.5 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3])",3GPP TS 22.261 [2] clause 6.2.3 Service continuity: Requirements

question 1274,What is the SNR target for higher CBWs assuming 16 and 20 dB? [3GPP Release 18],14.4 dB,18.6 dB,16 dB,20 dB,,option 3: 16 dB,The SNR target for higher CBWs assuming 16 dB is used.,Standards specifications,1274,3,"

Minimum FR2-1 DL radiated performance requirements are specified for up to Rank 2. The required SNR point is 14.4 and 18.6 dB for 16QAM and 64QAM respectively for 100 MHz and 120 kHz CBW/SCS combination. It can be approximately expected that SNR will not dramatically change for higher CBWs as 400MHz. Same time, some margin on phase noise impact at higher carrier frequency should be considered. For instance, 16 and 20 dB SNRs can be assumed. Such SNR targets require adjustments of TE parameters. Table 7.2.3-4 summarizes required wanted signal + headroom budget to reach 16 and 20 dB DL SNR. The parameters from Table 7.2.3-1 are assumed with RAN4 assumption on backoff from P1dB.","

These results show the relative degradation in SNR that can occur due to adjacent channel interferers leaking through the next larger BW filter, and the actual performance degradation will depend on a particular scenario, especially ACI strength and the UE channel filter overlap with the interfering signal. Typical 3GPP ACS requirements are conducted so that a UE should be able to meet 95% of the target throughput of the reference QPSK level when the adjacent interferer is 32dB higher than the wanted signal (and which corresponds to approximately -1.5dB SNR). Referring to the right-most point on the X-axis of Figure 6.1.3-3, it can be seen that 9MHz and 8MHz irregular channel SNR is above -1.5dB, while the 6MHz channel SNR is clearly below -1.5dB.","

In the case that an AMF fails and the 5G-AN/peer CP NFs detect that the AMF has failed, or the 5G-AN/peer CP NFs receives notification from another AMF in the same AMF set that this AMF has failed, following actions are taken:","If AMF failure is detected by 5G-AN, all NGAP UE TNLA binding for UEs served by that AMF are released.","If AMF failure is detected by 5G-AN, all NGAP UE TNLA binding for UEs served by that AMF are released.","

For UE(s) in CM-CONNECTED state, 5G-AN considers failure detection or failure notification as a trigger to release the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding(s) with the corresponding AMF for the respective UE(s) while maintaining N3 (user plane connectivity) and other UE context information. For subsequent N2 message, if the backup AMF information of the corresponding failed AMF is not available the 5G-AN should select a different AMF (as in clause 6.3.5) from the same AMF set when the subsequent N2 message needs to be sent for the UE(s). If no other AMF from the AMF set is available, then it can select an AMF (implementation dependent) from the same AMF Region as in clause 6.3.5.

[3GPP Release 18],"When the UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC_CONNECTED state and has received the ""RRC Inactive Assistance Information"" from the AMF",When CN based mobile terminating (MT) communication handling is requested for a UE with eDRX cycle value longer than 10.24 seconds for RRC_INACTIVE state,When the UE is registered in the network with negotiated eDRX parameters for CM-IDLE state and is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC_CONNECTED state,When the AMF provides the eDRX cycle value for CM-IDLE state to NG-RAN,,option 2: When CN based mobile terminating (MT) communication handling is requested for a UE with eDRX cycle value longer than 10.24 seconds for RRC_INACTIVE state,The NG-RAN initiates the Connection Inactive procedure with CN based MT communication handling when it is requested for a UE with eDRX cycle value longer than 10.24 seconds for RRC_INACTIVE state.,Standards specifications,1387,2,Figure 4.8.1.1a-1: NG-RAN initiated Connection Inactive procedure with CN based MT communication handling,"

For NR, the NG-RAN may request the CN to handle mobile terminated (MT) communication for the UE configured with eDRX for RRC_INACTIVE state by means of the Connection Inactive procedure with CN based MT communication handling Procedure (see clause 4.8.1.1a of TS 23.502 [3]). This allows the CN to apply high latency communication functions as specified in clause 5.31.8. The NG-RAN provides the determined eDRX values (i.e. the eDRX cycle length and the Paging Time Window length) for RRC_INACTIVE to AMF (i.e. >10.24s). Based on the request from NG-RAN, the AMF responds to NG-RAN and informs other NFs (e.g. SMF and UPF) involved in downlink data or signalling handling and trigger the data buffering as specified in clause 4.8.1.1a of TS 23.502 [3].","

This procedure may be initiated by the serving NG-RAN node when CN based mobile terminating (MT) communication handling is requested for a UE that is configured with eDRX cycle value longer than 10.24 seconds for RRC_INACTIVE state and has at least one PDU session with active user plane as defined in clause 5.31.7 of TS 23.501 [2].","

If NG-RAN has only pending user plane data for transmission, the NG-RAN node may keep the N2 connection active and based on implementation send indication to the CN requesting the CN based mobile terminated (MT) communication handling as described in clause 5.31.7.2.1, or initiate the AN Release procedure (see clause 4.2.6 of TS 23.502 [3]) based on local configuration in NG-RAN.","

Power headroom reports (PHR) are needed to provide support for power-aware packet scheduling. In NR, three types of reporting are supported: a first one for PUSCH transmission, a second one for PUSCH and PUCCH transmission in an LTE Cell Group in EN-DC (see TS 37.340 [21]) and a third one for SRS transmission on SCells configured with SRS only. In case of CA, when no transmission takes place on an activated SCell, a reference power is used to provide a virtual report. To allow network to detect UL power reduction, the PHR reports may also contain Power Management Maximum Power Reduction (P-MPR, see TS 38.101-2 [35]) information that UE uses to ensure UE compliance with the Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) exposure regulation for FR2, which is set for limiting RF exposure on human body.

For the Session Breakout scenario, only the 3GPP access should be allowed for the EC traffic, because the UL-CL is reachable only through that access, since there are no ATSSS procedures that would ensure that an UL-CL can be on path when the UE connects through a non-3GPP access. Based on the received EC related policy and deployment information the SMF may, however, select an UL-CL based on existing procedures if the UE connects through a 3GPP access. One simple solution to keep the EC traffic to 3GPP access is to set the Access Type Preference to ""3GPP"" in the corresponding URSP rule for this PDU Session. To avoid other, non-EC traffic be constrained to the 3GPP access, WIFI offload can be setup for that traffic using the ""Non-Seamless Offload indication"" as route selection in the corresponding URSP rule. An example URSP rule set is given in table 6.41.2-1.

MDAS producer also provides the geographical map within which the UEs would experience paging issues and hence will not be able to respond on a network-initiated paging. Based on the provided MDA output, MDAS consumer (e.g. AMF, gNB) decides on whether, when and where to initiate or not to initiate the paging procedures, thereby ensuring the efficient paging procedures and optimal network resource utilization, as paging can be initiated only when there are more chances for it to be successful.",Table 8.4.1.2.2-1: Enabling data for Paging Optimization Analysis

question 1810,What is the minimum number of unique grid points based on the simulation results for the non-uniform measurement grids? [3GPP Release 18],200,275,300,320,366,option 3: 300,"Based on the simulation results, the minimum number of unique grid points for the non-uniform measurement grids is approximately 300.",Standards specifications,1810,3,"

Simulation with 2000 random offsets up to 10cm were performed together with random permutations of the beam peak direction (rotation in , , and twist  as outlined in Clause G.1 of [3]). Table 5.1.4.4-11 shows the simulation results for the non-uniform measurement grids considered the most suitable for PC1 devices. The average number of unique grid points based on all simulations investigated is ~900 which shows a significant test time reduction with the same TRP MUs as the 5o measurement grid with uniform spacing in  and , Table 5.1.4.4-10. For PC1, TRP test cases with a non-uniform angular spacing in  and  do not require additional measurement uncertainty due to reduced range length for range lengths exceeding 20cm if the path loss correction is applied for measurement grids with step size of 2.5o within ±20o of the NF beam peak and step size of 10o outside ±20o of the NF beam peak.","

The minimum number of measurement grid point for TRP/EIRP/EIS was investigated in [3] in which a completely random fashion is applied for both  and   dimensions. For multi-Rx chain DL reception UE RF testing, it has already known that measured performance of a UE is expected to systematically vary as a function of position. This systematic variation means that the strategy to completely randomize the orientation of the UE to determine MU does not apply. Moreover, for the measurement grid analysis for multi-Rx, the AoA pairs lie along longitudes of the UE reference coordination system, and the requirements apply only for the UE-declared orientation in the positioner. Therefore, it is agreed that uncertainty mechanism for multi-Rx chain DL reception UE RF testing is limited to the coarseness of the grid and doesn’t depend on the UE random orientations as the legacy approach.","

Another important set of analyses was performed for the constant-step size grids beyond 3 GHz where the EIRP at the pole of  = 180° was either set to a very small number/null (due to a potential blockage due to the positioner /pedestal), extrapolated from the second to last cut (mean of all EIRPs), or extrapolated from two neighbouring points 15° off the pole, i.e., EIRP(=165°, =0°) and EIRP(=165°, =180°). Those results for the standard deviations and the mean errors summarized in Table 9.2-4 and 9.2-5, respectively. From the standard deviations in 9.2-4, it can be observed that the impact of how the EIRP at  = 180° is treated has little effect for measurement grids as coarse as 26 grid points while a small increase in standard uncertainty can be seen for the coarsest grid with 14 points regardless of whether the final grid point does not yield a reasonable measurement or whether it is extrapolated from the second to last cut. When the pole point is not measured and considered to be a deep null, unacceptable mean errors are observed for very coarse grids. The mean errors in Table 9.2-5 show that the averaging of the pole from the 2nd to last cut or the extrapolation of the two point 15° off the pole yield very good agreement with the previous simulations that assume the grid point at the pole can be measured without any obstruction/blockage. Those two approaches are illustrated in Figure 9.2-14 for a measurement grid using the ==45° grid where the grid point at=180° (shown in blue) is extrapolated either using 8 existing measurements at=135° (shown in red) on the left or with two new grid points at=165° (shown in red) on the right. The advantage of the more extrapolation approach using two new grid points at =165° becomes more evident when considering the coarsest measurement grid presented here, i.e., ==60°, which could be considered for IoT or RedCap devices in the future. The extrapolation approach of the grid point at=180° that relies on either on the existing 8 measurements at =135° or the two close neighbours at =165° is considered necessary for above 3 GHz TRP measurement grids for the most accurate extrapolation and lowest MUs. ","

Given the large number of grid points, additional test time reduction techniques based on non-uniform grids were investigated. The focus of this investigation is for the antenna array offset applied, i.e., the offset must be known/declared which can be used to determine the NF beam peak direction. The idea here is to apply a fine grid around the NF beam peak direction to capture the main portion of the very directive beam while a coarse grid around the remaining portion of the sphere is applied. This is further illustrated in Figure 5.1.4.4-12 with the following non-uniform TRP grid assumptions:","

It is now assumed that the test points in 3D are based on a constant-step size grid with 266 unique grid points (Dq=Df=15°), i.e., as defined for PC1 & PC3 spherical coverage test cases for 1-DL in Clause 5.3 of [6], or on a constant density grid with 200 unique grid points, i.e., as defined for PC1 spherical coverage test cases for 1-DL in Clause 5.3 of [6]. These test/grid points are visualized in Table 5.3.1-1."

To improve the reliability of the DL data channel, PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) repetition can be configured to a UE for a given TTI length. If configured, the PDSCH DCI format 1A or 7-1x monitored by the UE on the user specific search space indicates K consecutive PDSCH transmissions with the same Resource Block (RB) allocation, Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) and HARQ process, where K takes a value in {1, 2, 3, 4 or 6}. Thus, the number of PDSCH transmissions for a given transport block is changed dynamically as shown in the figure below. The HARQ-ACK feedback for the transport block is sent only once with the timing given by the Kth PDSCH transmission. Only the Redundancy Version (RV) can be different within the window of K transmissions, if configured accordingly. A maximum rank of 2 is supported with slot/subslot PDSCH repetition and DMRS sharing cannot be used with subslot PDSCH repetition.",PDSCH repetition,,,

UE-group wake-up signals (GWUS): Reduced UE power consumption in idle mode was enabled in Rel-15 by the introduction of the wake-up signal (WUS), a compact signal transmitted a configurable time before the paging occasion (PO) when a UE is being paged, allowing the UE to maximize its sleep time during periods when there is no paging. In Rel-16, an enhancement is introduced that allows a WUS to wake up a configurable group of UEs rather than all UEs that happen to monitor the same PO. This helps reduce the power consumption even further. The mapping of GWUS in the time and frequency domains is highly configurable.","

The UE power saving work in Rel-16 focuses on the power saving techniques in CONNECTED state, which includes DRX adaptation, cross-slot scheduling, maximum MIMO layer adaptation, and fast transition out of CONNECTED state.

The procedure for estimating the energy consumption of VNF/VNFCs based on the vCPU usage of underlying virtual compute resources is as follows:","

In Release 17 (see [2] clause 6.7.3.1), the Energy Consumption (EC) of VNFs is obtained by summing up the estimated energy consumption of its constituent Virtualized Network Function Components (VNFC), where the estimated energy consumption of a VNFC is obtained by taking the estimated energy consumption of the virtual compute resource instance on which the VNFC runs. The energy consumption of a virtual compute resource instance X is estimated as a proportion of the energy consumption of the NFVI node on which the virtual compute resource instance X runs. This proportion is obtained by dividing the vCPU mean usage of the virtual compute resource instance X, by the sum of the vCPU mean usage of all virtual compute resource instances running on the same NFVI Node as X, during the same observation period.","6.3.2	Solution for energy consumption of VNF/VNFCs

A Multi Access (MA) PDU Session established over the 5G core (5GC) network typically has user-plane resources over a 3GPP access connected to 5GC and user-plane resources over a non-3GPP access connected to 5GC. In Rel-17, however, the user-plane resources over 3GPP access may be established in EPC (through a PDC Connection).

In Rel-16, the earlier transmission of UL data payload has been further enhanced by introducing UL transmission using preconfigured uplink resources (PUR). When the feature is configured, both the random-access preamble transmission (Msg1) and the random-access response (Msg2) can be omitted, and the data transmission can be completed in only two messages (i.e., Msg3 and Msg4).","

In Rel-16, the earlier transmission of UL data payload has been further enhanced by introducing UL transmission using preconfigured uplink resources (PUR). This feature allows eNB to configure uplink resources, in which a UE in IDLE mode can send UL transmission without performing random access procedures. The UE can be potentially configured with a cyclic shift of DMRS, which allows sharing of the preconfigured resources under which up to two users can transmit NPUSCH simultaneously when the NPUSCH transmission is larger than or equal to 64ms for 12-tone allocation. By skipping the random access procedures, the uplink transmission efficiency can be improved and UE power consumption is reduced. Before performing a PUR transmission, the UE must evaluate the validity of the timing advance (TA) based on either individual or combined usage of any of the following attributes: a) serving cell change, b) TA timer, c) RSRP change. Additionally, it is possible to configure the TA as always valid within a given cell.","NR	New Radio (the radio interface of 5G)

question 2654,"In online charging without reservation, what happens if the OCS rejects the resource usage request? [3GPP Release 18]",The NE disallows the resource usage.,The OCS initiates a refund for the original resource usage.,The NE returns the resource usage authorisation to the network element.,The network element executes the resource usage according to the user request and the OCS authorisation.,,option 1: The NE disallows the resource usage.,"In the case of event based charging without reservation, if the OCS rejects the resource usage request, the NE disallows the resource usage.",Standards specifications,2654,1,"

	For each charging event received during the session, the OCS/CCS decides whether to authorise the resource usage or whether to decline the request (e.g. when the subscriber account does not contain sufficient credit). If, at any time within the session, the OCS/CCS determines not to authorise the chargeable event, it rejects the request sent by the network element/network functions, causing the NE/NF to disallow the resource usage pertaining to that chargeable event. It must be noted that this does not necessarily terminate the user session. E.g. in the case of credit exhaustion, the session could be redirected to a credit recharging site.","

2)	The OCS rejects the initial resource usage request at session start, i.e. no Credit-Control session is started. In this case, the NE disallows the start of the session or, if the session was already allowed to start as described in item 1 above, enforces the termination of the user session.","

Session based online charging always involves reservation within the Credit-Control procedure (SCUR), as there is no way for the OCS to predict the amount of resource usage that occurs during the user session. To begin with, the CTF forward generates a charging chargeable event that corresponds to the resource usage request and maps onto the user session, and forwards it to the OCF. In the OCS, the online charging session is started and a certain amount reserved from the user subscriber account. This amount is determined by the OCS based on the information in the charging event and on local configuration, i.e. operator policy. A resource usage quota, matching the reserved amount, is then returned by the OCS, at which point the user session starts in the NE. Further charging events are sent from the NE to the OCS upon the detection of further chargeable events within the session .e.g. the expiry of in intervals configured on the NE or instructed by the OCS, or when the authorised quota expires, or when session characteristics change (e.g. change of QoS of an IP CAN bearer). The OCS then furnishes a new quota to the NE as required, or rejects the charging event, e.g. due to expiry of credit on the subscriber account. The OCS also furnishes the NE’s behaviour on quota expiry (termination action). When the user session terminates normally in the NE, a final statement on the actually used network resources is returned to the OCS, enabling the OCS to calculate the final value of the actual resource usage session and to properly debit the corresponding final amount from the subscriber account (possibly resulting in a re-crediting of previously reserved amounts). This also terminates the Credit-Control session for the particular user session. The following exceptions and abnormal cases are defined for the SCUR scenario:","

For both event and session based charging, it has been specified above that the NE/NF shall disallow the requested resource usage when the associated chargeable event is not authorised by the OCS/CCS. The most typical case for the OCS/CCS to refuse authorisation is the expiry of the subscriber account. However, depending on operator policy, even in the case of account expiry the OCS/CCS may determine to allow the resource usage to occur / to continue. For example, if the interruption of the user session renders the complete session useless to the end user, it would be unfair to debit the user’s account for the portion of the session that was executed. While the decision making procedures and the special treatment of this situation are internal to the OCS/CCS, the important aspect to note is that the OCS/CCS must grant authorisation towards the network in order to allow the event to occur or the session to continue, effectively making the event or (remainder of the) session free of charge.","1)	The OCS rejects the resource usage request.

The standardization of VoLTE roaming with S8HR architecture impacts several areas, and was then handled by a number of 3GPP groups:","

Security aspects (SA3-LI Study Item ""FS_LIV8""). For S8HR VoLTE roaming architecture, the SGW is the only network node that locates in the VPLMN. Based on architectural assumption, the VPLMN need to access VoLTE for lawful interception purpose. The study Item ""FS_LIV8"" identifies new network deployment to make this procedure possible.","One of the main implications is that the S8HR roaming architecture is not using the Local Breakout anymore and, therefore, the IMS APN is resolved to point to a PGW in the HPLMN. So the IMS NNI between Home and Visited PLMN for VoLTE roaming will be different whether the S8HR architecture is used or not.","

Up to 16 repetitions is introduced for a Msg3 PUSCH transmission scheduled by RAR UL grant or DCI format 0_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI. This is beneficial to enhance the coverage on both NUL and SUL. After carrier selection and BWP selection during the RACH initialization procedure, a UE requests repetition of Msg3 PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant via separate PRACH resource when the RSRP of DL path-loss reference fulfils a configured threshold. If requested by the UE, gNB decides whether or not to schedule repetition of the Msg3 PUSCH transmission. If scheduled, the number of repetitions N is indicated by the 2 MSBs of the MCS field in the RAR UL grant or in the DCI format 0_0; and the MCS index used for the PUSCH transmission is indicated by the 2 LSBs of the MCS field in the RAR UL grant or by the 3 LSBs of the MCS field in the DCI format 0_0. The Msg3 PUSCH transmission is performed over N slots, which is counted based on available slots. Only inter-slot frequency hopping is supported if N>1 is indicated for the PUSCH transmission. ","

DMRS bundling to enable improved channel estimation is introduced for PUSCH repetition Type A scheduled by DCI format 0_1 or 0_2, for PUSCH repetition Type A with configured grant, for PUSCH repetition Type B, for TB processing over multiple slots PUSCH and for PUCCH repetitions of PUCCH formats 1, 3, and 4. A UE can report the maximum duration, in number of consecutives slots, during which the UE is able to maintain power consistency and phase continuity under certain tolerance level. With the duration of the nominal TDWs (Time Domain Windows), not longer than the maximum duration, configured by gNB, one or multiple nominal TDWs can be determined for PUSCH transmissions or PUCCH repetitions. A nominal TDW consists of one or multiple actual TDWs. Events, which cause power consistency and phase continuity not to be maintained across PUSCH transmissions or PUCCH repetitions within the nominal TDW, are defined. An actual TDW is terminated in case an event occurs. A new actual TDW is created in response to semi-static events not triggered by DCI or MAC-CE. Whether a new actual TDW is created in response to dynamic events triggered by DCI is subject to UE capability. Frequency hopping and UL beam switching for multi-TRP operation are regarded as semi-static events. The UE shall maintain power consistency and phase continuity within an actual TDW across PUSCH transmissions or PUCCH repetitions.",,,

The network shall be able to apply volume-base charging to a subscriber regardless of whether the subscriber’s traffic has been offloaded from the mobile operator’s network as described in 3GPP TS 22.101 [1]. ","

It is a requirement that users shall be able to obtain service and use chargeable services with networks with whom neither they nor their home environment have any direct commercial agreement. This shall be enabled by interworking via trusted third parties. Each Home Environment shall interwork with one or more serving network operators, with whom they would negotiate a commercial roaming agreement and test the interworking. Any user wishing to use the services of a particular serving network would register with that serving network, that would either directly or indirectly interwork with the home environment. Fraud and cost control mechanisms shall be used to ensure that charges incurred for 3GPP services do not exceed the credit limits set. This can be applied for the user and the other roles involved in commercial dealings. In practice, any serving network shall be capable of operating as a roaming broker.","

In addition, the network operators have to charge each other for the use of their networks by roaming users. The methods of charging between operators may be different from the methods used to charge the user. For example, a user may be charged by duration for voice sessions made while roaming but the home network may pay the visited network by volume of data used. Based on preconfiguration or indication from the home network, the serving network may be aware that charging information per individual subscription is not needed. In that case the serving network may omit detailed collection of chargeable events per individual subscription and instead base roaming charging of the home network on optimised collection of chargeable events.",Figure 6.17.3-1: Procedure for enabling traffic switching between two non-3GPP access paths,"

It shall be possible for a network operator to charge its users for activities while roaming so that the home network will get the capability to raise service charges depending on the roamed to network, e.g. because of inter operator charges for the use of service capabilities within the visited network which will in general depend on the serving network. The ability to supply all the necessary information for all the charging options will depend on the capability of the visited network. For service capabilities which are provided by the home network, however, it is required that the charging information is collected to allow to identify the serving network of the served subscriber;"

The framework and the initial results for new codecs demonstrate coding performance improvements over H.265/HEVC for some codecs of up to 50%. However, the initial results are not considered mature enough to support concrete recommendations on adding new codecs. The potential addition of any new codec in 3GPP services and specifications requires diligent preparation, including the identification of needs and requirements for different scenarios, as well as a complete characterization against existing codecs. The information in this TR, as well as any new developments in 3GPP with respect to codecs in latest specifications, could serve as a baseline for future work. Such an effort may lead to conclusions on the potential addition of any new codec in 3GPP services and specifications. However, no immediate need has been identified to initiate such follow-up work.","

This is the first time that 3GPP has done such an extensive baseline work for video codec evaluation and characterization. The study item was backed and supported by 23 3GPP members. While the framework is comprehensive, it was also identified that it clearly has some limitations; for example, encoder configurations for each scenario may have not been stringent enough in their definition, leading to results that may not be fully comparable. Furthermore, the encoders used for the evaluation of the various codecs have different maturity and features. Results in this document should always be considered with a clear understanding of the characterization conditions and these results were derived.

For each PSFCH reception occasion, from a number of PSFCH reception occasions, the UE generates HARQ-ACK information to report to higher layers. For operation with shared spectrum channel access, the UE attempts to receive PSFCH on  PSFCH occasion(s), as described in clause 16.3.0, until the UE detects one PSFCH from each UE expected to transmit a PSFCH, or the UE attempts to receive PSFCH on all the  PSFCH occasion(s). For generating the HARQ-ACK information, the UE can be indicated by a SCI format to perform one of the following ","

If a UE would transmit  PSFCHs in a PSFCH transmission occasion, the UE first transmits PSFCHs with HARQ-ACK information from  PSFCHs corresponding to the smallest priority field values from the  priority field values, if any. Subsequently, the UE transmits remaining PSFCHs with conflict information corresponding to the smallest remaining priority field values from the  priority field values, if any.","

If a UE receives a PSSCH in a resource pool and the HARQ feedback enabled/disabled indicator field in an associated SCI format 2-A/2-B/2-C has value 1 [5, TS 38.212], the UE provides the HARQ-ACK information in a PSFCH transmission in the resource pool. For operation without shared spectrum channel access, the UE transmits the PSFCH in a first slot that includes PSFCH resources and is at least a number of slots, provided by sl-MinTimeGapPSFCH, of the resource pool after a last slot of the PSSCH reception. For operation with shared spectrum channel access, the UE can attempt to transmit the PSFCH over a number of first  slots, provided by sl-candidatePSFCH-Occasions and indexed from 1 to  in ascending order in time, that include PSFCH resources and are at least a number of slots, provided by sl-MinTimeGapPSFCH, of the resource pool after a last slot of the PSSCH reception.

The architecture for supporting RNs is shown in Figure 4.7.2-1. The RN terminates the S1, X2 and Un interfaces. The DeNB provides S1 and X2 proxy functionality between the RN and other network nodes (other eNBs, MMEs and S-GWs). The S1 and X2 proxy functionality includes passing UE-dedicated S1 and X2 signalling messages as well as GTP data packets between the S1 and X2 interfaces associated with the RN and the S1 and X2 interfaces associated with other network nodes.

In phase II of RN operation (see clause 4.7.6.3), the DeNB also embeds and provides the S-GW/P-GW-like functions needed for the RN operation. This includes creating a session for the RN and managing EPS bearers for the RN, as well as terminating the S11 interface towards the MME serving the RN.","

The X2 control plane protocol stack for supporting RNs is shown in Figure 4.7.4-2. There is a single X2 interface relation between each RN and its DeNB. In addition, the DeNB may have X2 interface relations to neighbouring eNBs. The DeNB processes and forwards all X2 messages between the RN and other eNBs for all UE-dedicated procedures. The processing of X2-AP messages includes modifying S1/X2-AP UE IDs, Transport Layer address and GTP TEIDs but leaves other parts of the message unchanged.","

question 3853,What is the purpose of EAS Relocation on Release 16 capabilities? [3GPP Release 18],To enable roaming PDU Sessions,To provide low packet loss in the network,To support Edge Relocation involving AF change,To describe example procedures for EAS Relocation,,option 4: To describe example procedures for EAS Relocation,EAS Relocation on Release 16 capabilities is described in Annex F and provides example procedures for EAS Relocation.,Standards specifications,3853,4,EAS Relocation may involve EAS context migration in the case of stateful applications. The following examples are part of the application implementation details and fall out of 3GPP specification scope:,"

3GPP TS 23.548 [8] and 3GPP TS 23.558 [10] specifies that, service continuity is required for EAS relocation and service continuity relies on application layer support of seamless context/status relocation between the EAS servers. Transport layer connection re-establishment also causes service interrupts. Thus EAS IP replacement is also discussed in 3GPP TS 23.548 [8], assuming that real-time transport layer relocation is supported between the source EAS and target EAS. However, the real-time context/status relocation and transport layer real-time relocation are not always supported for the verticals/enterprises. In those cases where network support is not available, the application enablement layer can support this functionality for the application. The data delivery enabler service in network can maintain the transport layer connection with corresponding client in the UE. EAS can use such data delivery enabler service for EAS relocation (including context transfer and lossless packet transfer). Such data delivery enabler can ensure the UE's service continuity including seamless data delivery and enhanced transport layer management.","

4.	The UE's mobility event triggers the execution of an Application Context Relocation (ACR) procedure as described in 3GPP TS 23.558[10]. Any of the ACR scenarios detailed in 3GPP TS 23.558[10] clauses 8.8.2.2-8.8.2.6 may occur. In this step, the first three phases of the ACR procedure are performed, up to ACT. In this step VAL Server 1 acts as EAS 1 and VAL Server 2 as EAS 2, therefore participating in corresponding signaling. VAL server 2 has been selected as SEALDD-enabled server meeting the ACR criteria to be the target EAS (see precondition 1).","

There is an EAS IP replacement feature defined in 3GPP TS 23.548 [8] which allow an AF to perform server change (e.g. due to load re-balance) without impacting the UE (i.e. UE is not aware of EAS change). In Figure 6.10.1.3-1, the differences comparing to Figure 6.10.1.2-1 are:",Enhancement on the 3GPP TS 23.558 clause 8.3.3 Service Provisioning and 8.5	EAS discovery

These mechanisms include the functionality provided by various network elements, the communication between them and the storage of associated data. This TS provides a conceptual description of a service architecture and architecture requirements which aim to provide service capabilities.

NR sidelink supports sidelink HARQ-ACK for sidelink unicast and groupcast services for improved reliability. Two sidelink HARQ feedback operations are defined, HARQ-ACK with ACK and NACK, and HARQ-ACK with NACK only. When ACK/NACK operation is used, the sidelink HARQ-ACK procedure is similar to that of Uu for non-codeblock group feedback, i.e. the HARQ-ACKis transmitted based on the success or failure of the whole transport block. NACK-only operation is defined for groupcast to allow a a larger number of Rx UEs to share a single PSFCH resource by sending feedback only when a Rx UE receives SCI but fails to decode the transport block. The transmission of NACK-only feedback can be restricted to UEs within given a radius, and any UE beyond it does not provide any HARQ-ACK. This minimum range requirement of a service is provided together with the associated QoS parameters from service layers.

question 4397,How is the relationship between radiation field and power pattern defined in general? [3GPP Release 17],As a linear equation,As a quadratic equation,As an exponential equation,As a mathematical function,,option 2: As a quadratic equation,The document states that the relationship between radiation field and power pattern is given by a quadratic equation.,Standards specifications,4397,2,radiation pattern: angular distribution of the radiated electromagnetic field or power level in the far field region,"

This approximation in turn corresponds to a power (field) dependence in the NF of 1/r4 (1/r2) which is commonly observed in the radiative NF. CST simulations were used to further support this formulation. Here, an 8x2 antenna array, placed at (0,0,0), was evaluated. Two measurements at r1 and r2 were used to estimate the asymptotic expansion coefficients bi; this allowed to estimate the power/EIRP at various distances which was can be compared with actual CST simulations at those distances. The behaviour and the normalized power (compensating the path loss) estimated from two sets of two measurements at (r1, r2) of (7.5cm, 9.5cm) and (20cm, 22cm) simulated at various distances (>r2) are shown in Figure 5.1.4.1-1.","

Load-Balancing with the UE-assistance indication: When the network indicates that a data flow should be steered with the load-balancing steering mode, the network may also provide a ""UE-assistance indication"" which indicates that (a) the UE may decide how to distribute the UL traffic of the matching data flow based on the UE's internal state (e.g., based on UE’s battery level), and that (b) the UE may inform the UPF how it decided to distribute the UL traffic of the matching data flow.","

	Typically, the UE-assistance indicator can be provided for data flows for which the network has no strong steering requirements. For example, when the network has no strong steering requirements for the default traffic of an MA PDU Session, the network can indicate (i) that this traffic must be steered with Load-Balancing steering mode using 50% - 50% split percentages, and (ii) that the UE is allowed to use other split percentages, such as 0% - 100%, if this is needed by the UE to optimize its operation (e.g., to minimize its battery consumption).","

Load-Balancing without pre-defined split percentages: This introduces enhancements to the Load-Balancing steering mode, which is a steering mode that splits the traffic of a data flow (in uplink and downlink direction separately) across the 3GPP and the non-3GPP accesses. In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages (referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP access, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17, however, the network may provide an ""autonomous load-balance indicator"" in which case the UE and the UPF can freely and independently select their own percentages for each access type. The selected percentages may change over time, e.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select the percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput. This means that using a load-balancing steering mode with the ""autonomous load-balance indicator"" can maximize the throughput of a given data flow in the uplink and in the downlink direction.",,

Besides the discovery of the capabilities of ML entities, services are needed for identifying which AI/ML capabilities are used in specific use case and how. 3GPP TS 28.105 [4] defines the inferenceType which indicates the type of inference, i.e. the use case that the ML model supports. This indicator may be represented by the MDA type (see 3GPP TS 28.104 [2]), Analytics ID(s) of NWDAF (see 3GPP TS 23.288 [3]), types of inference for RAN-intelligence, and vendor's specific extensions.","

For getting the inference output, the MDA MnS (see 3GPP TS 28.104 [2]) already supports MDA reporting by notifications, file and data streaming. The same approach can be applied to reporting other kinds of inference output (NWDAF analytics report, RAN intelligence output). A common data format may be defined for all kinds of inference outputs, and the format will be decided in normative phase.","After the joint training of ML entities, to test and check if the ML entities can work correctly under certain runtime contexts, the consumer may request the joint testing to verify whether multiple ML entities can synergically work before applying it to the target inference function.

question 5451,What is the term for the interference between UL and DL transmissions in different cells due to atmospheric ducting? [3GPP Release 18],RIM interference,Backhaul-based interference,CLI interference,Remote interference,Semi-static interference,option 4: Remote interference,The interference between UL and DL transmissions in different cells due to atmospheric ducting is termed as remote interference.,Standards specifications,5451,4,"

The atmospheric ducting phenomenon, caused by lower densities at higher altitudes in the Earth's atmosphere, causes a reduced refractive index, causing the signals to bend back towards the Earth. A signal trapped in the atmospheric duct can reach distances far greater than normal. In TDD networks with the same UL/DL slot configuration, and in the absence of atmospheric ducting, a guard period is used to avoid the interference between UL and DL transmissions in different cells. However, when the atmospheric ducting phenomenon happens, radio signals can travel a relatively long distance, and the propagation delay exceeds the guard period. Consequently, the DL signals of an aggressor cell can interfere with the UL signals of a victim cell that is far away from the aggressor. Such interference is termed as remote interference. The further the aggressor is to the victim, the more UL symbols of the victim will be impacted.","

When different TDD DL/UL patterns are used between neighbouring cells, UL transmission in one cell may interfere with DL reception in another cell: this is referred to as Cross Link Interference (CLI).","

When different TDD DL/UL patterns are used between neighbouring cells, UL transmission in one cell may interfere with DL reception in another cell: this is referred to as Cross Link Interference (CLI).","

When atmospheric ducting phenomenon happens, radio signals can travel a relatively long distance, and the propagation delay goes beyond the gap. In this case, the downlink signals of an aggressor base station can travel a long distance and interfere with the uplink signals of a victim base station that is far away from the aggressor. Such interference is termed as 'remote interference'. When it happens, the IoT of the victim base station demonstrates a ""sloping"" characteristic, the closer the uplink symbol is to gap, the higher interference it experienced. The reason behind this is that, the remote interference is caused by accumulated signals from a number of remote base stations with different distances.","

The framework and the initial results for new codecs demonstrate coding performance improvements over H.265/HEVC for some codecs of up to 50%. However, the initial results are not considered mature enough to support concrete recommendations on adding new codecs. The potential addition of any new codec in 3GPP services and specifications requires diligent preparation, including the identification of needs and requirements for different scenarios, as well as a complete characterization against existing codecs. The information in this TR, as well as any new developments in 3GPP with respect to codecs in latest specifications, could serve as a baseline for future work. Such an effort may lead to conclusions on the potential addition of any new codec in 3GPP services and specifications.

question 5557,When is priority treatment applied in MPS? [3GPP Release 18],Only after the MPS session is released,During the invocation and session establishment and until the MPS session is released,Before the invocation,Only during the invocation,,option 2: During the invocation and session establishment and until the MPS session is released,"Some form of priority treatment is applied to the MPS invocation and session establishment, and continues to be applied until the MPS session is released.",Standards specifications,5557,2,"

MPS provides priority treatment to increase the probability of an authorized Service User’s Voice, Video, and Data communication session being successful. Some form of priority treatment is applied to the MPS invocation and session establishment, and continues to be applied until the MPS session is released. The priority treatment may be applied before the invocation if a greater probability of success in receiving, recognizing, and processing the invocation is needed.","

MPS session: A session for which priority treatment is applied for allocating and maintaining radio and network resources to support the Multimedia Priority Service (MPS). MPS is defined in 3GPP TS 22.153 [31].","

The 3GPP network shall be able to provide priority treatment to an MPS-subscribed UE before the MPS application service invocation (e.g., priority treatment for the default and IMS signalling bearers establishment based on a subscription profile).","

Providing priority treatment to MPS-subscribed UEs during attachment/registration for radio access and network connectivity before the MPS application service session invocation requests improves the probability of an MPS session request being successful. This involves providing priority treatment for the signalling during the UE attachment for radio access and network connectivity based on a subscription profile. Prior to accessing subscription related information in the network, subscription related information stored in the UE is used, e.g., membership in the special access class required to be reserved for MPS use as per 3GPP TS 22.011 [6], or the special Access Identity used for MPS as per 3GPP TS 22.261 [7]. Without such priority treatment, a Service User’s UE might fail to gain radio access network and CN connectivity which in turn means that there is no access to the MPS application services (Voice, Video, and Data). Priority treatment before MPS session request increases the probability of successful MPS session establishment and any associated process for the Service User authorization (e.g., credential collection). ","

MPS can be supported for MMTEL voice/video calls and data sessions when the access to the EPC/5GC is WLAN and the 3GPP system is used for the MPS authorization.  In this case, MPS priority treatment can be provided by:"

In Release 17 (see [2] clause 6.7.3.1), the Energy Consumption (EC) of VNFs is obtained by summing up the estimated energy consumption of its constituent Virtualized Network Function Components (VNFC), where the estimated energy consumption of a VNFC is obtained by taking the estimated energy consumption of the virtual compute resource instance on which the VNFC runs. The energy consumption of a virtual compute resource instance X is estimated as a proportion of the energy consumption of the NFVI node on which the virtual compute resource instance X runs.

If the uplink sub-carrier spacing f = 15 kHz, there are 12 consecutive sub-carriers. If the uplink sub-carrier spacing f = 3.75 kHz, there are 48 consecutive sub-carriers.","

The downlink transmission scheme is based on conventional OFDM using a cyclic prefix. The OFDM sub-carrier spacing is f = 15 kHz. 12 consecutive sub-carriers during one slot correspond to one downlink resource block. In the frequency domain, the number of resource blocks, NRB, can range from NRB-min = 6 to NRB-max = 110 per CC or per Cell in case of CA or DC.","

The physical layer random access transmission uses a 3.75 kHz or 1.25 kHz sub-carrier spacing and consists of symbol groups with frequency hopping between symbol groups. Each symbol group has a cyclic prefix and a preamble. Symbol groups with 3.75 kHz sub-scarrier spacing hop by one or six sub-carriers in frequency, and symbol groups with 1.25 kHz subcarrier spacing hop by one, three, or eighteen sub-carriers in frequency. Repetitions of groups of symbol groups hop by a pseudo-random number of sub-carriers in frequency.

The transmission of, for instance, program code and configuration data may be handed to the 3GPP system as data burst. In this case, the ingress data rate exceeds the capacity of the network, which implies that some of the data has to be stored within the ingress node of the communication system before it can be transmitted to the egress interface(s). However, the application consuming the communication service requires that the data of such a burst needs to be transmitted completely.

Typically, due to the type of the collected data used for model training/inference for 5GC or RAN, the performance of a model in 5GC or RAN may be biased in some respects. On the other hand, the 3GPP management system collects data of longer range and from a wide scope of RAN nodes/5GC, which consequently implies that the predictions calculated by the management system will be unbiased towards the overall RAN nodes/5GC. However, 3GPP management system predictions may lack insight of patterns related to specific node behaviour or finer granularity of time. Hence with coordination or alignment of the ML capability among 5GC/RAN and 3GPP management system, the overall performance may be improved.",NOTE 2:	Pre-trained ML model storage and provisioning to NWDAF is out of the scope of 3GPP.,"NOTE:	The ML model training capability is specified in 3GPP TS 28.105 [4].

Load-Balancing without pre-defined split percentages: This introduces enhancements to the Load-Balancing steering mode, which is a steering mode that splits the traffic of a data flow (in uplink and downlink direction separately) across the 3GPP and the non-3GPP accesses. In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages (referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP access, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17, however, the network may provide an ""autonomous load-balance indicator"" in which case the UE and the UPF can freely and independently select their own percentages for each access type. The selected percentages may change over time, e.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select the percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput. This means that using a load-balancing steering mode with the ""autonomous load-balance indicator"" can maximize the throughput of a given data flow in the uplink and in the downlink direction.","

The load reporting function is executed by exchanging load information over the Xn/X2/F1/E1 interfaces.

As documented in TS 22.261 [2], the AI/ML operation may be split between UE application client and AF. The UE application client performs local AI/ML operation for the privacy-sensitive and delay sensitive part and sends the intermediate data to the AF. The AF executes the remaining parts and feeds the inference results back to the device. This AI/ML operation requires reliable and low latency data transmission for the AI/ML traffic. Moreover, 5G system should be able to expose the predicted changes of network condition (i.e. bitrate, latency, reliability) per UE to an authorized third party as specified in the TS 22.261 [2]. Currently, the network condition related information, like the Network Slice load predictions information, NF load analytics and Network performance analytics are already supported in TS 23.288 [6]. If the 5GS can expose these analytics output to the UE application client, it is beneficial by the UE client to decide the AI/ML operation splitting, e.g. the UE application client may decide to perform the AI/ML operation when the Network Slice load is not high, the gNB status and resource usage that indicated in Network performance analytics output is in good condition.","[8]	3GPP TR 22.874: ""Study on traffic characteristics and performance requirements for AI/ML model transfer in 5GS""."

Availability and reliability are used both in 3GPP and vertical industries, but with different meanings. Communication service availability addresses the availability of a communication service. This definition follows the vertical standard IEC 61907 [7]. On the other hand, reliability is a 3GPP term and addresses the availability of a communication network. The relation of both terms is depicted in figure F-1 for a mobile network.","

Annex F in TS 22.104 [2] depicts relation of reliability and communication service availability. It has the following description, ""Communication service availability addresses the availability of a communication service. This definition follows the vertical standard IEC 61907 [7]. On the other hand, reliability is a 3GPP term and addresses the availability of a communication network.""","

As depicted, reliability covers the communication-related aspects between two nodes (here: end nodes), while communication service availability addresses the communication-related aspects between two communication service interfaces. This might seem to be a small difference, but this difference can lead to situations, where reliability and communication service availability have different values.","

Communication links are tested, e.g. every minute by means of ping messages end to end, to identify availability and latency. The effective availability of 3GPP telecommunications networks observed in practice can be more like 98.5 % (where availability means ability to achieve communication with the expectations of performance according to the service level agreement. While this is far below the levels energy utility operators expect from 5G and that are cited in stage 1 requirements, the fact is that observations of performance of past generations indicate that in order to achieve the target availability, information is needed.

question 8114,What does the UE provide to the AS for slice aware cell reselection? [3GPP Release 17],Slice-Maximum Bit Rate,S-NSSAI,NSSRG,S-MBR,NSAG information,option 5: NSAG information,The UE provides the NSAG information and their priorities to be considered during cell reselection to the AS.,Standards overview,8114,5,"

In the UE, NAS provides the NSAG information and their priorities to be considered during cell reselection to the AS. When a UE supports slice aware cell reselection, and NSAG specific cell reselection information is provided to the UE, then the UE performs the slice aware cell reselection. The details of slice aware cell reselection are specified in TS 38.304. In general, the UE can derive reselection priorities for slice aware cell reselection, and then perform cell reselection evaluation using legacy evaluation criteria.

The work on AKMA TLS protocol profiles provides the details on how to use the newly introduced AKMA key (see [4]) to provide secure TLS connection between the UE and an Application Function (AF) in the network. ","

The AKMA WID [4] introduced a method of generating keys for use between a UE and an Application Function (AF) in the network. These keys are generated from a key derived by an authentication run over the 5G core (see [2]). The ""AKMA TLS protocol profiles"" work item specifies how to use these AKMA key to provide secure TLS connections, either using certificate-based TLS and HTTP Digest with the AKMA key in the TLS tunnel or using symmetric key TLS using the AKMA key. The specification of the profiles is based on the methods standardised to utilise GBA keys in TS 33.222 [1] and TS 24.109 [3]. ","[3]	TS 29.535: ""5G System; AKMA Anchor Services; Stage 3""
